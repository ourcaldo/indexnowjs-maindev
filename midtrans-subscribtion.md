Authorization
To ensure secure client server communication, every API call should be authorized. Out of the various Authorization methods available, Midtrans uses BASIC AUTH. The format for BASIC AUTH is Username:Password. Using BASIC AUTH, API key can be passed as either Username or Password. For Midtrans, API key is passed as the Username, paired with an empty value for Password. It is then encoded into Base64 format and used as the authorization header.


Authorization Header

The Midtrans authorization header follows HTTP(S) BASIC AUTH convention. It utilizes Merchant Server Key as Username and blank value for Password.


Authorization Header Example

To get the authorization header, follow the steps given below.

Get the Server Key.
The Server Key is unique for Sandbox environment and Production environment. To obtain the respective Server Key follow the links given below.

Server Key for Sandbox environment
Server Key for Production environment
Replace Username and Password.
The BASIC AUTH format is Username:Password. Replace Username with Server Key and leave Password blank.
So, this results in a string {Your_Server_Key}:.

Encode the resulting string to Base64 format.

Include this Base64 encoded string in the HTTP(S) header. Prepend the authorization method (Basic) and a space ( ) to the encoded string. The authorization header is as given below:

Authorization: Basic [Base64({Your_Server_Key}:)]


For an example key, refer to the table given below.

Server Key	SB-Mid-server-abc123cde456
BASIC AUTH format	SB-Mid-server-abc123cde456:
Base64	U0ItTWlkLXNlcnZlci1hYmMxMjNjZGU0NTY6
Authorization	Basic U0ItTWlkLXNlcnZlci1hYmMxMjNjZGU0NTY6

ðŸ“˜
Note

Remember to include : to the Server Key before passing it to the Base64 encoder

The Authorization Header given in the example is for reference only. Please use your own Sandbox/Production Server Key to create your API key.

The API keys for Sandbox and Production are different. When going live, generate new API Keys to access the live endpoints.

API Methods
Subscription API (also called as Recurring) is intended for recurring transactions - transactions that deduct customer's funds at a pre-defined time interval. Supported payment method currently are Card Payment and GoPay (for GoPay Tokenizations). Subscriptions are supported in both Snap Checkout and Core API integration.

You can perform recurring transaction by creating subscription details.
Midtrans will attempt to auto-deduct customer funds at the set time interval based on the subscription details (subscription schedule, amount, currency, and so on) created.


API Methods
HTTP Method	Endpoint	Definition
POST	/v1/subscriptions	Create a subscription that contains all the details for creating transaction.
GET	/v1/subscriptions/subscription_id	Retrieve the subscription details with a given subscription_id.
POST	/v1/subscriptions/subscription_id/disable	Disable the customer's subscription. The customer will not be charged in the future for this subscription.
POST	/v1/subscriptions/subscription_id/enable	Enable the customer's subscription.

Create a subscription or recurring transaction by sending all the details required to create a transaction. The details such as name, amount, currency, payment_type, token, and schedule are sent in the request. Successful request returns id status:active, and other subscription details.

Subscription API currently supports idempotency when creating subscription. If you're using the same idempotency key, you will continue to receive the same response. Subscription will validate the request body first before performing the idempotency check - this idempotency applies for the next 3 minutes for the same key.

Obtaining GoPay token
Get Pay Account API is called to retrieve GoPay Token, needed for GoPay subscriptions. Account ID can be retrieved from HTTP notification of first transaction charge that will be used to create subscription for the scheduled subsequent charges.

For the sandbox environment, refer to this [documentation] to learn how to obtain the GoPay token. Note that you must use specific phone numbers provided in the documentation in order to create the GoPay token required for creating a subscription.

OPTIONAL : Authenticating first transaction for GoPay Subscription

All payment transactions beyond the linking step will not have an additional authentication challenge e.g. PIN challenge in GoPay app. As such all additional authentication - if deemed as needed- will need to be set up in merchant's web/app directly between merchant and customers, before initiating the payment charge to Subscription API.

Do note that during onboarding, you might be required to perform authentication on first transaction - this is referring to merchant's own authentication, as this is not part of Subscription API / GoPay Tokenization payment flow.

Retry Mechanism if Subscription Fails

If for some reason deduction fails, Midtrans will perform automatic retries 3 times for every one hour by default (unless customized) before marking subscription as inactive. Retries for every charge will be attempted until exhausted regardless of subscription's status. To test for the automatic retries, you can try to simulate with cases that returns error such as incorrect card token, or GoPay account is in unlinked state prior to charge.

If you do not want to retry your failed subscription charge, simply specify the max_interval parameter in the retry_schedule object as 0.


ðŸ“˜
Retry notification

Note that Midtrans Payment API will send HTTP notification for every transactions' attempt; while Midtrans's Subscription API will send a separate notification at the end of retry attempt cycle of every transaction or once retry is successful. As such, use Subscription HTTP notification should be referred to when handling failed or success subscriptions.


Example of retry schedules :
There's a payment that's failed to be processed at 11 Oct 2022 15.48 GMT+7. Then, Midtrans will automatically retry at :

11 Oct 2022 16.48 GMT+7
11 Oct 2022 17.48 GMT+7
11 Oct 2022 18.48 GMT+7

OPTIONAL - Accepting Subscription in Snap Checkout

Use this object to show a dedicated recurring flow UI in Snap - differences include card will be automatically saved without having user manually tick the checkbox and adjusted copy to better suit recurring payments. Snap will then return the information passed here back in HTTP notification, for you to utilize when creating a subscription via the Subscription API.

Use this object in conjunction with Subscription API - add this object to alter the Snap customer UI, then convert the transaction to recurring payments using Subscription API. Make sure to also have the prerequisites to accept Subscription (e.g. One Click feature) - otherwise transactions might fail.

Note that if you do choose to pass the start_time and interval_unit within the object, make sure to use the same information when calling the Subscription API - otherwise, information presented to user and actual subscription charge schedule will be different, which might result in chargeback.

Note

Disable subscription does not stop any pending retries on subscription. Pending retry is caused by failure on previous subscription payment. Any pending retries will still be executed after subscription is disabled for trying to resolve previous pending payments.

Note

Payment method cannot be updated in the middle of subscription. If merchant wish to change the payment method of an active subscription, the subscription must be disabled first. After that, new subscription with same data can be created again with different payment method.

Inside schedule, only interval field can be updated. schedule.interval_unit and schedule.max_interval can not be updated.

Any updates to the subscription interval schedule will only be effective after the next scheduled payment is processed. For example, consider a subscription scheduled to run at the end of this month. If you update the interval field in the middle of the month, change will take effect from the next month. For other parameters, the change will be effective starting from the next scheduled payment.

To reactivate dead subscriptions, simply update the subscription schedule with future dates. Subscription will then reactivate and resume charging the customer at the date specified at next_execution_at.
