 * DEPRECATED: Manual Recurring Payment Processing Route
 * 
 * This route has been disabled because Midtrans handles recurring payments automatically.
 * 
 * How Midtrans Recurring Payments Work:
 * 1. Customer subscribes with saved card token
 * 2. Midtrans automatically charges on scheduled dates
 * 3. Midtrans sends webhook notification to: /api/v1/payments/midtrans/webhook
 * 4. Webhook handler processes the payment confirmation and updates user access
 * 
 * No manual intervention required.
