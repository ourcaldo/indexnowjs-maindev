**Last Updated: September 06, 2025**

IndexNow Studio and its affiliates ("IndexNow Studio," "we," "our," and/or "us") value the privacy of individuals who use our website and related services (collectively, our "Services"). This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") explains how we collect, use, and share information from or about you or your device as you use the Services. By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to our Terms of Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

We may collect a variety of information from or about you or your devices from various sources, as described below.

If you do not provide your information when requested, you may not be able to use some or all of our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with our Services or if we are legally required to collect it.

### A. Information You Provide to Us

**Registration and Profile Information**. When you register for an account, we ask you for your email address, full name, and may also request your phone number and country information. If you sign up using a social media account, we will also receive information from those social media services such as your name, email address, and profile photo, in accordance with your privacy settings on those social media services.

**Payment Information**. When you add a credit card or payment method to your account, our third-party payment processor Midtrans will receive and process your payment card information. We may store tokenized payment information for recurring billing purposes.

**Business and SEO Data**. When you use our Services, you provide us with website URLs, domains, keywords, search terms, ranking data, and other SEO-related information that you wish to track and analyze.

**Communications**. When you communicate with us, we may receive additional information about you. For example, when you communicate with our Customer Support Team, we will receive your name, email address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide. If you subscribe to our newsletter, then we will collect certain information from you, such as your email address. When we send you emails, we may use technologies such as web beacons to track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve our Services.

**Google Service Accounts**. If you connect Google service accounts for indexing purposes, we will receive and store your service account credentials and configuration data necessary to provide indexing services.

### B. Information We Collect Automatically When You Use Our Services

When you use the Services, we use a variety of electronic tools, such as cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies (collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as "cookies") to automatically generate information about how you use and interact with the Services as discussed in this section.

**What are Cookies?** Cookies are small files of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer, or small graphic images placed on web pages or in emails. They can be stored either for a single browser session or more permanently. We use cookies to collect information about your browsing activities, distinguish you from other users, provide functionality, and analyze use of the Services. Our third-party partners, such as analytics providers, may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different services. The types of cookies we and third parties may use to collect information are as follows:

- **Strictly necessary cookies.** Some cookies are strictly necessary to make the Services available to you. We cannot provide you with the Services without this type of cookies. These include authentication tokens and session management cookies.
- **Functional cookies.** These are used to recognize you when you return to the Services. This enables us to adapt our content for you, and remember your preferences (for example, your sidebar layout preferences).
- **Analytical or Performance cookies.** We also use cookies for analytics purposes in order to operate, maintain and improve our Services. We may use our own analytics cookies or use third party analytics providers to collect and process certain analytics data on our behalf. These providers may also collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources.

**What information do we automatically collect as you use the Services?**

**Device Information**. We receive information about the device and software you use to access our Services, including internet protocol (IP) address, Internet Service Provider, web browser type, operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application installations, device type and identifiers, and mobile advertising identifiers.

**Location Information**. We may infer your general location information from other information we collect from and about you (for example, your IP address may indicate your general geographic region). We do not collect precise geolocation data.

**Usage Information**. To help us understand and analyze how you use our Services and to help us improve them, we automatically receive information about your interactions with our Services, like the pages or other content you view or interact with, the searches you conduct, your comments, any content you enter or post, keywords you track, and the dates and times of your visits.

**Activity Logging**. We maintain comprehensive activity logs including login/logout events, feature usage, and security events for audit trail and compliance purposes.

### C. Information We Receive from Third Parties

**Information from third party services.** If you choose to link our Services to a third-party account (such as Google Search Console), we may receive information about you, including your profile information and your use of the third-party account, in accordance with your settings on such third-party account. If you wish to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your third-party accounts to learn about your options.

**Payment Processors**. We receive transaction information from our payment processing partners including payment status, billing details, and transaction IDs for subscription management purposes.

**Other third parties.** We may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or IP geolocation data, from third parties such as data or marketing partners and combine it with other information we have about you.

## 2. How We Use the Information We Collect

We use the information we collect:

- To provide, maintain, improve, and enhance our Services including rank tracking, keyword monitoring, and URL indexing;
- To communicate with you, provide you with updates and other information relating to our Services, provide information that you request, respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide customer support;
- To facilitate the connection of third-party services or applications, such as Google APIs for indexing;

- To personalize your experience on our Services such as presenting tailored content and dashboard configurations;
- To facilitate transactions and payments and manage subscriptions;
- To detect and prevent fraud, and respond to trust and safety issues that may arise;
- For compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service or other legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency;
- To generate analytics and insights about Service usage and performance;
- To maintain comprehensive audit trails and activity logging for security and compliance; and
- For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time the information is collected.

**De-Identified Information.** Please note that we may de-identify the information we collect from and about you so that it can no longer be reasonably linked to you or your device. Once information has been de-identified in this way, we can use and share it for any purpose in our discretion, and this Privacy Policy no longer applies to such information.

## 3. Legal Bases for Processing Information

Various global privacy laws (such as those in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Brazil) require that we have a "legal basis" to process your information. The legal bases on which we rely to process your information include:

- **Consent.** You have consented to the use of your information, for example, where legally required, to send you marketing communications or to connect third-party services.
- **Contractual necessity.** We need your information to provide you with the Services, for example to facilitate your registration, provide rank tracking services, process payments, and respond to your inquiries.
- **Compliance with a legal obligation.** We have a legal obligation to use your information, for example to comply with tax and accounting obligations, or to maintain audit trails as required by data protection laws.
- **Legitimate interests.** We have a legitimate interest in using your information for a business purpose that does not override your individual rights and interests. For example, we have a legitimate interest in using your information for product development and internal analytics purposes, to improve the accuracy of our SEO tracking technologies, fraud prevention, and otherwise to improve the safety, security, and performance of our Services.

## 4. How We Share the Information We Collect

We share information with the following categories of third parties.

**Affiliates.** We may share any information we receive with our corporate affiliates under common ownership or control for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the Services.

**Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.** We may disclose and transfer your information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

**How to Block Cookies.** You can change your browser settings to block, disable, or notify you when you receive a Cookie, delete Cookies, or browse our Services using your browser's anonymous usage setting. However, if you use your browser settings to block all Cookies (including essential Cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our Services, or some portions of the Services may not function properly.

In addition, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, including in your country of residence, place of work or where an incident took place.
- You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us regarding the processing of your information, at any time and free of charge. We will apply your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you withdrew your consent.

Before responding to your request, we may ask you to provide reasonable information to verify your identity. Please note that there are exceptions and limitations to each of these rights, and that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
