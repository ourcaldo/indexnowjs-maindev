# IndexNow Studio - Professional Web Application

## Project Overview

IndexNow Studio is a professional-grade, full-stack web application designed to automate Google URL indexing through the Google Search Console API. Built as a comprehensive solution for SEO professionals, digital marketers, and website owners who need efficient large-scale indexing operations with advanced monitoring and reporting.

### Core Purpose
The application provides instant indexing capabilities similar to RankMath's Instant Indexing plugin, but as a standalone web platform that handles multiple service accounts, scheduled jobs, and enterprise-scale indexing operations.

### Key Features
- **Automated Google Indexing**: Submit thousands of URLs to Google's Indexing API automatically
- **Multi-Service Account Management**: Load balance across multiple Google service accounts
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Support for one-time, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly indexing jobs
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time job tracking, quota monitoring, and detailed analytics
- **Professional Email Notifications**: Branded email reports for job completion, failures, and quota alerts
- **Enterprise Security**: Role-based access control, input validation, and security auditing

## CRITICAL PROJECT CAUTIONS - ALWAYS REMEMBER

⚠️ **ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Next.js ONLY** - This project uses Next.js with NO VITE. Never suggest or implement Vite migration.
2. **Supabase Self-Hosted** - Database is hosted at https://base.indexnow.studio
   - Do NOT install PostgreSQL locally
   - Do NOT push database changes locally
   - For any database updates/changes/additions/removals, provide SQL queries for user to run in Supabase SQL Editor
   - You must be follow this prefix "indb_{collections}_{table-name}" "collections" is like same collections, for example like "security" collection which have tables "indb_security_event", "indb_security_log" and so-on.
3. **Project Color Scheme ONLY** - Use ONLY this project's color scheme:
   - Background: #FFFFFF (Pure White), #F7F9FC (Light Gray)
   - Primary: #1A1A1A (Graphite), #2C2C2E (Charcoal)
   - Accent: #3D8BFF (Soft Blue)
   - Text: #6C757D (Slate Gray)
   - Success: #4BB543 (Mint Green)
   - Warning: #F0A202 (Amber)
   - Error: #E63946 (Rose Red)
   - Borders: #E0E6ED (Cool Gray)
   - Button Colors: #1C2331, #0d1b2a, #22333b, #1E1E1E
   - If user sends reference images, they are for layout/UI inspiration ONLY - still use project colors

## Current Database Schema (Supabase Tables)
If an updates affectig the database and RLS. You need to provide the SQL Query for me to run in Supabase SQL Editor. Keep in mind that to make new tables, you must be follow this prefix "indb_{collections}_{table-name}" "collections" is like same collections, for example like "security" collection which have tables "indb_security_event", "indb_security_log" and so-on.

All tables use `indb_` prefix and are located at https://base.indexnow.studio:

## Recent Changes

### September 4, 2025: CMS Page Editor Duplicate Toast Notification Fix ✅

**✅ DUPLICATE TOAST NOTIFICATION ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed multiple duplicate toast notifications appearing when editing and saving CMS pages
-- **Issue**: When editing a page and clicking save, users were seeing 2-4 identical toast notifications saying "Page updated successfully" and "Your page 'Privacy Policy' has been updated and published"
-- **Root Cause**: Both the parent component (edit page) AND the PageForm component were showing toast notifications after successful operations
-- **Technical Analysis**: 
  - Edit page handler (`app/backend/admin/cms/pages/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) showed toast after API call succeeded
  - PageForm component (`components/cms/PageForm.tsx`) showed ANOTHER toast after onSubmit prop succeeded
  - This created a chain: User saves → PageForm calls onSubmit → Edit page shows toast → PageForm shows another toast
-- **Solution**: Removed duplicate toast logic from PageForm component while preserving error handling
  - PageForm now only handles error toasts (when API calls fail)
  - Parent components (create/edit pages) handle all success toasts
  - This ensures only one toast per action with contextual messaging

**✅ CONTEXTUAL TOAST MESSAGING IMPROVEMENT**: Enhanced toast messages to show accurate status change information
-- **Issue**: Toast messages always said "has been updated and published" even when status didn't change
-- **Enhancement**: Toast messages now track original status and only mention status changes when they actually occur
-- **Examples**:
  - Content-only changes: "Your page 'Privacy Policy' has been updated."
  - Status changes: "Your page 'Privacy Policy' has been updated and published."
  - Unpublishing: "Your page 'Privacy Policy' has been updated and unpublished."
-- **Result**: Toast notifications are now accurate and contextual, eliminating user confusion

**Files Modified:**
-- `components/cms/PageForm.tsx` - Removed duplicate success toast logic, kept error handling
-- `app/backend/admin/cms/pages/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Enhanced toast messaging with status change tracking

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Toast notification system now works correctly with single, contextual messages

### September 4, 2025: Critical CMS Pages Authentication Fix & Homepage Feature Removal ✅

**✅ PUBLIC CMS PAGES AUTHENTICATION FIX**: Fixed critical authentication redirect issue preventing public access to CMS pages
-- **Issue**: CMS pages like `/privacy-policy` were redirecting to login instead of being publicly accessible
-- **Root Cause**: AuthContext was using whitelist approach that blocked dynamic CMS pages not explicitly listed in publicRoutes array
-- **Solution**: Changed authentication logic from whitelist to blacklist approach - only protect specific routes (like `/dashboard`) that require authentication
-- **Technical Fix**: Modified `lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to use `protectedRoutes` array instead of `publicRoutes` whitelist
-- **Result**: All CMS pages are now publicly accessible without requiring authentication, resolving user accessibility issues

**✅ HOMEPAGE MANAGEMENT FEATURE COMPLETE REMOVAL**: Removed entire homepage management system as requested by user
-- **Backend API Cleanup**: Removed homepage functionality from all API routes in `app/api/v1/admin/cms/pages/`
  - Removed `is_homepage` filtering from GET endpoint
  - Removed homepage setting logic from PUT endpoint (including auto-unset of other homepage pages)
  - Removed homepage deletion protection from DELETE endpoint
-- **Frontend UI Cleanup**: Removed all homepage management UI components and navigation
  - Removed "Homepage Settings" link from pages list (`/backend/admin/cms/pages`)
  - Removed homepage badges from pages list and edit page headers
  - Removed unused `Home` icon import
-- **Type Definitions Cleanup**: Cleaned up all TypeScript interfaces and types
  - Removed `is_homepage` field from `CMSPage` interface in `types/pages.ts`
  - Removed `is_homepage` fields from all request interfaces (`PageCreateRequest`, `PageUpdateRequest`, `PageFilters`)
  - Removed `HomepageSettings` and `HomepageUpdateRequest` interfaces entirely
  - Updated CMSPage interfaces in all template components (LandingPageContent, AboutPageContent, ContactPageContent, ServicesPageContent)
-- **Result**: Homepage management feature completely removed from system with no remaining references

**🎯 TECHNICAL IMPACT**:
-- **Authentication**: CMS pages now function as truly public content without authentication barriers
-- **Code Cleanup**: Removed ~200+ lines of homepage-related code across backend, frontend, and type definitions
-- **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminated complexity of homepage designation system and associated management interfaces
-- **User Experience**: CMS pages like privacy policy are now immediately accessible to visitors without login redirects

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Both authentication fix and homepage removal successfully implemented and tested

### September 4, 2025: Blog Category Filter Fixes - API Response & Missing Category Buttons Resolution ✅

**✅ CATEGORY API RESPONSE VERIFICATION**: Confirmed blog posts API already returns proper category labels
-- **Status**: Posts API (`/api/v1/blog/posts`) was already correctly returning both category slug and category_name fields
-- **Response Structure**: API provides `"category": "case-studies"` and `"category_name": "Case Studies"` for proper display
-- **Result**: User requirement for category labels in API response was already implemented and working correctly

**✅ CATEGORY FILTER BUTTONS RESTORED**: Fixed missing category filter buttons by correcting categories API post count logic
-- **Issue**: Category filter buttons were not appearing in BlogFilters component due to empty categories API response
-- **Root Cause**: Categories API was filtering by `post_count > 0` but the post_count field wasn't being maintained when posts were published
-- **Solution**: Replaced static post_count filtering with dynamic calculation of actual published posts per category
-- **Enhanced**: Categories API now queries `indb_cms_posts` table to count real published posts for each category
-- **Result**: Category buttons ("All", "Case Studies", "General") now appear correctly in blog archive filters

**✅ CATEGORIES API OPTIMIZATION**: Improved `/api/v1/blog/categories` endpoint performance and reliability
-- **Before**: Relied on unmaintained `post_count` field that wasn't updating with new posts
-- **After**: Dynamic calculation using Promise.all to count actual published posts for each category
-- **Filtering**: Only returns categories that have published posts (`status = 'published'` AND `published_at IS NOT NULL`)
-- **Response Format**: Returns categories with proper id, name, slug, and accurate count fields
-- **API Response**: Now correctly returns `{"categories":[{"id":"...","name":"Case Studies","slug":"case-studies","count":1},{"id":"...","name":"General","slug":"general","count":11}]}`

**Files Modified:**
-- `app/api/v1/blog/categories/route.ts` - Replaced static post_count filtering with dynamic published post calculation
-- `components/debug/CategoryDebug.tsx` - Created temporary debug component for API testing (removed after fixing)
-- `app/(public)/blog/components/BlogArchiveContent.tsx` - Temporarily added debug component for testing (removed after verification)

**Result:** Blog category filtering now works completely - API returns proper category labels AND category filter buttons appear correctly in the UI. Both user-reported issues have been resolved successfully.

### September 4, 2025: CMS Pages Template System Removal & Critical Fixes ✅

-- **Solution**: Removed duplicate submit button from main form area, kept only the one in PagePublishControls sidebar
-- **UI Cleanup**: Now has single clear "Save Page" button with proper loading states
-- **Result**: No more confusion about which button to use or unexpected double submissions

**✅ PGRST116 DATABASE ERRORS RESOLVED**: Fixed "no rows returned" errors when accessing pages
-- **Issue**: Pages were showing PGRST116 errors ("JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned") 
-- **Root Cause**: Page routing was trying to fetch template-specific data and complex joins that no longer exist
-- **Solution**: Simplified page queries to only fetch necessary page data without template-specific logic
-- **Routing Fixed**: Updated dynamic [slug] routing to always use DefaultPageContent component instead of template switching
-- **Database Cleanup**: Removed template-related query logic from page fetching functions
-- **Result**: Pages now load correctly without database errors - privacy-policy, terms, etc. all working

**✅ HOMEPAGE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETELY REMOVED**: Eliminated inappropriate homepage settings from CMS pages

-- **Previous Behavior**: Showed blue shield icon + site name + "User Dashboard" subtitle when logoUrl was null/undefined
-- **New Behavior**: Shows only actual logo image when logoUrl exists, completely empty space when no logo available
-- **Conditional Logic**: Changed from `logoUrl ? logo : fallback` to `logoUrl && logo` pattern
-- **Layout Preserved**: Sidebar structure and spacing remain intact, only branding fallback removed

**Result**: Sidebar now displays only genuine logo branding when configured, with no placeholder elements when logo is unavailable.

### September 1, 2025 11:45: Pricing Display Bug Fix ✅

**✅ PRICING DISPLAY BUG RESOLVED**: Fixed payment amount showing $0 instead of actual package pricing
-- **Root Cause**: Billing overview API was hardcoding amount_paid to 0 when subscription data came from user profile rather than formal subscription records
-- **API Enhancement**: Updated `app/api/v1/billing/overview/route.ts` to calculate actual pricing based on package pricing tiers
-- **Currency Logic**: Added proper currency detection using user's country from profile data via `getUserCurrency()` utility
-- **Pricing Calculation**: Implemented proper amount calculation using package pricing_tiers based on user currency and billing period

**Technical Implementation**:
-- **Import Added**: Added `getUserCurrency` import from currency utils for proper currency detection
-- **Profile-Based Pricing**: When subscription comes from user profile, now calculates actual amount using package pricing tiers
-- **Fallback Logic**: Maintains fallback to package.price if pricing_tiers structure is unavailable
-- **Currency Support**: Properly handles both IDR and USD pricing based on user's country (Indonesia = IDR, others = USD)
-- **Billing Period**: Respects package billing period (monthly/yearly) for accurate pricing calculation

**Code Changes**:
-- **Lines 105-127**: Enhanced subscription data creation logic to calculate proper amount_paid
-- **Currency Detection**: Uses `getUserCurrency(userProfile.country)` to determine user's currency
-- **Pricing Tiers**: Accesses `userProfile.package.pricing_tiers[billingPeriod][userCurrency]` for accurate pricing
-- **Promo Support**: Prioritizes promo_price over regular_price when available

**Result**: Users now see correct payment amounts in their subscription details instead of $0, improving billing transparency and user experience.

**Result:** Order success page now correctly displays payment details for all payment methods, shows complete package information, uses proper project colors, and reflects correct branding

### August 31, 2025 17:45: Next.js 15 Billing Orders API Fix ✅

**✅ NEXT.JS 15 ASYNC PARAMS COMPATIBILITY**: Fixed critical API route error preventing order success page from loading
- **Root Cause**: Next.js 15 requires `params` object to be awaited before accessing properties
- **Error Fixed**: "Route used params.order_id. params should be awaited before using its properties"
- **Solution Applied**: Updated `/api/v1/billing/orders/[order_id]/route.ts` params type to `Promise<{ order_id: string }>` and properly awaited params object
- **Database Column Fix**: Corrected API to use existing `transaction_status` column instead of non-existent `payment_status` column

- **Root Cause**: System was attempting to manually charge customers using saved card tokens via direct Midtrans Core API calls instead of letting Midtrans handle recurring billing automatically
- **Error Pattern**: `'transaction_details.gross_amount is required'` validation errors from malformed API payloads
- **Correct Architecture**: Midtrans handles recurring payments automatically via their subscription system and sends webhook notifications when charges are successful
- **Payment Flow**: Customer subscribes → Midtrans auto-charges on schedule → Webhook notification → System processes confirmation

**✅ DISABLED MANUAL BILLING SCHEDULER**: Removed incorrect recurring billing job that was causing payment failures
- **Worker Startup**: Disabled `recurringBillingJob` initialization in `/lib/job-management/worker-startup.ts`
- **API Route**: Deprecated `/api/v1/billing/midtrans/process-recurring/route.ts` with proper 410 Gone status
- **Job Processing**: Removed manual charge creation logic that was creating invalid payment requests
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminated the source of recurring payment validation errors

**✅ WEBHOOK-BASED PROCESSING CONFIRMED**: Verified existing webhook handler properly processes subscription payments

**Result**: Registration form now provides proper phone number validation with clear error messages and new users are created with NULL package_id as intended.

### August 30, 2025 17:15: Database Schema Update Fix - Price Column Migration ✅

**Issue**: Backend admin user profile pages were throwing database errors because queries were still referencing the deprecated `price` column instead of the new `pricing_tiers` column in the `indb_payment_packages` table.

**Error**: 
```
Profile fetch error: {
  code: '42703',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'column indb_payment_packages_1.price does not exist'
}
```

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `app/api/v1/admin/users/[id]/route.ts` - Updated package query to use `pricing_tiers` instead of `price`
- ✅ `app/api/v1/admin/orders/[id]/route.ts` - Updated package query to use `pricing_tiers` instead of `price`  
- ✅ `app/api/v1/admin/orders/route.ts` - Updated package query to use `pricing_tiers` instead of `price`
- ✅ `app/api/v1/admin/settings/packages/route.ts` - Removed deprecated `price` field from INSERT operations
- ✅ `app/api/v1/admin/settings/packages/[id]/route.ts` - Removed deprecated `price` field from UPDATE operations
- ✅ `app/api/v1/auth/user/trial-eligibility/route.ts` - Updated ordering from `price` to `sort_order`

**Database Schema Alignment**:
- **Old Schema**: Used `price` column for package pricing
- **New Schema**: Uses `pricing_tiers` column with structured pricing data for multiple currencies/billing periods
- **Result**: All admin backend functionality now properly aligned with current database schema

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Backend admin user profiles now load correctly
- ✅ Order management pages display package information properly
- ✅ Package settings no longer attempt to write to non-existent columns
- ✅ Trial eligibility checks work without database errors
- ✅ System properly uses the new tiered pricing structure

**Testing**: Verified admin backend loads user profiles without database errors.

**Additional Fix**: Fixed frontend component `PackageSubscriptionCard.tsx` that was still expecting old `price` field instead of new `pricing_tiers` structure, preventing JavaScript runtime errors on user profile pages.

- **Root Issue**: After tokenization fix, system was bypassing required 3DS authentication and treating pending 3DS transactions as successful payments
- **Security Impact**: Users' credit card payments were not going through proper 3DS security verification, creating security vulnerabilities
- **Payment Processor Bug**: `usePaymentProcessor.handlePaymentSuccess()` was treating 3DS redirect responses as successful payments instead of throwing 3DS errors
- **Error Propagation Fix**: Modified both `processPayment()` and `processCreditCardPayment()` to properly re-throw 3DS authentication errors
- **Flow Restoration**: Checkout page now correctly catches 3DS errors and triggers authentication modal as intended in original design

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/payment-services/midtrans-client-service.ts`: Fixed SDK loading and tokenization implementation to match original working code exactly
- `hooks/usePaymentProcessor.ts`: Fixed 3DS authentication error handling to properly throw errors instead of treating as success
- **Result**: Complete payment flow now working - tokenization ✅ + 3DS authentication ✅ + payment security ✅

- **Database Structure Fix**: Updated code to properly retrieve Midtrans server_key and client_key from `indb_payment_gateways.api_credentials` column
- **Authentication Success**: Fixed 401 "Access denied due to unauthorized transaction" error by using correct API credentials storage
- **Implementation**: Updated both Snap token creation and response payload to use credentials from api_credentials column

**✅ AMOUNT CALCULATION & CURRENCY DETECTION BUG RESOLVED**:
- **Dynamic Pricing Implementation**: Replaced hardcoded IDR currency selection with proper user currency detection logic
- **Currency Detection Fix**: Fixed hardcoded `userCurrency = 'IDR'` to use `getUserCurrency(country)` - defaults to USD, IDR only for Indonesia
- **Multi-Structure Support**: Enhanced amount calculation to support multiple pricing_tiers structures (new and legacy formats)
- **USD to IDR Conversion**: Proper currency conversion using `convertUsdToIdr()` with live exchange rates for Midtrans API
- **Comprehensive Fallbacks**: Added intelligent fallback logic: pricing_tiers[period][currency] → pricing_tiers.regular[period] → base package price
- **Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging to identify pricing structure and currency conversion steps
- **Transaction Metadata**: Store both original (USD/IDR) and converted (IDR) amounts in database for audit trail

**✅ UNIFIED PAYMENT API ENHANCED**:

### August 21, 2025: Midtrans 3DS Payment Database Recording Fix ✅

**✅ CRITICAL: Midtrans 3DS Payment Database Recording Issue Resolved**:
- **Root Cause Identified**: 3DS callback endpoint was not saving payment records to database after successful authentication
- **Issue Impact**: Payments processed successfully via 3DS but no records appeared in `indb_payment_transactions` or `indb_payment_midtrans` tables
- **Payment Flow Problem**: Main endpoint → 3DS redirect → Frontend authentication → Callback endpoint (❌ NOT saving to database)
- **User Experience**: Frontend showed success toast but package remained inactive due to missing database records

**✅ COMPREHENSIVE 3DS CALLBACK ENDPOINT RECONSTRUCTION**:
- **Database Integration**: Implemented complete database saving logic in `app/api/billing/midtrans-3ds-callback/route.ts`

- **Completed Payment Handling**: For completed transactions - shows "Payment has been processed successfully. No further action required."
- **Button State Management**: Upload button disabled and shows "Payment Completed" for completed transactions
- **Dynamic Instructions**: Payment instructions change from "Upload payment proof" to status-appropriate messages

**✅ CUSTOMER DATA COLLECTION ENHANCEMENT - CRITICAL FIX**:
- **Database-First Approach**: 3DS callback now retrieves original customer data from `indb_payment_transactions.metadata.customer_info`
- **Real Checkout Data**: Uses actual customer information submitted in checkout form (first_name, last_name, phone, email)
- **Transaction Record Query**: Queries `indb_payment_transactions` using `gateway_transaction_id` to find original submission
- **Data Accuracy**: Eliminates "Customer" placeholder names with real customer data from checkout form submission
- **Complete Customer Info**: Preserves all customer details exactly as entered during payment process

**✅ PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS SMART DISPLAY**:

### 2025-08-21: Midtrans JSONP Tokenization Fix & Clean UI Implementation ✅

**✅ CRITICAL: Midtrans Infinite Loading Issue Resolved**:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Midtrans uses JSONP (JSON with Padding) callback mechanism, not standard JavaScript callbacks
- **JSONP Response Format**: Midtrans responds with `MidtransNew3ds.callback({"status_code":"200","token_id":"48111111-1114-8a7994ac-0119-461a-ac23-65ebc5c87730"})`
- **Global Callback Override**: Implemented temporary override of `window.MidtransNew3ds.callback` to capture token responses
- **Proper State Management**: Added callback restoration and timeout handling to prevent conflicts
- **Browser Console Cleanup**: Removed all frontend debug logs - debugging moved to server-side only
- **Currency Conversion Fix**: Implemented proper USD to IDR conversion using live exchange rates (e.g., $49 → ~Rp 775,000)
- **TypeScript Resolution**: Fixed type casting issues with global callback function access

**Technical Solution Summary**:
The infinite loading was caused by waiting for a callback parameter that never executed. Midtrans actually calls a global `MidtransNew3ds.callback()` function with the tokenization response. The fix involved:
1. Temporarily overriding `window.MidtransNew3ds.callback` 
2. Capturing the JSONP response when Midtrans calls the global callback
3. Extracting the token_id from the response object  
4. Restoring the original callback to avoid conflicts
5. Proper timeout and error handling throughout the process

  - **Schema**: `id`, `keyword_id` (FK), `position`, `url`, `search_volume`, `difficulty_score`, `check_date`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - **Unique Constraint**: One record per keyword per date (`keyword_id`, `check_date`)
  - **Purpose**: Stores historical ranking positions for each keyword on daily basis
- ✅ **ENHANCED KEYWORDS TABLE**: Added `last_check_date` column to `indb_keyword_keywords`
  - **Purpose**: Tracks when each keyword was last processed for daily ranking update
  - **Logic**: Server skips keywords where `last_check_date = CURRENT_DATE`
- ✅ **AUTOMATIC RANKING UPDATE**: Created trigger system for latest position management
  - **Trigger Function**: `update_latest_keyword_ranking()` automatically updates `indb_keyword_rankings`
  - **Data Flow**: New records in `indb_keyword_rank_history` → automatically update latest position in `indb_keyword_rankings`
  - **Constraint**: Added unique constraint on `keyword_id` in `indb_keyword_rankings` table
- ✅ **DATA POPULATION**: Migrated existing keywords to new rank history system
  - **Process**: Inserted all active keywords from `indb_keyword_keywords` into `indb_keyword_rank_history` with NULL positions
  - **Result**: Existing user keywords now ready for daily tracking system
- ✅ **ROW LEVEL SECURITY**: Implemented RLS policies for `indb_keyword_rank_history`
  - **Policy**: Users can only access rank history for their own keywords
  - **Security**: Maintains data isolation between users

### DAILY KEYWORD TRACKING LOGIC FLOW:

**Backend Server Process (Daily Execution):**
1. **Query Keywords to Track**: `SELECT * FROM indb_keyword_keywords WHERE is_active = true AND (last_check_date != CURRENT_DATE OR last_check_date IS NULL)`
2. **Track Each Keyword**: Call Google Search Console API to get current ranking position
3. **Store Daily Record**: Insert into `indb_keyword_rank_history` with today's date and position
4. **Update Last Check**: Set `last_check_date = CURRENT_DATE` in `indb_keyword_keywords`
5. **Auto-Update Latest**: Trigger automatically updates `indb_keyword_rankings` with latest position

**Data Flow:**
```
indb_keyword_keywords (source) 
    ↓ (daily server process)
indb_keyword_rank_history (historical data)
    ↓ (automatic trigger)
indb_keyword_rankings (latest positions)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Performance**: Overview page loads quickly from `indb_keyword_rankings` (latest only)
- **History**: Rank History page shows 30+ days from `indb_keyword_rank_history`
- **Efficiency**: Server skips already-tracked keywords using `last_check_date`
- **Reliability**: Trigger ensures latest rankings always stay synchronized

  - **Issue**: User had 100+ keywords in `indb_keyword_keywords` but zero records in `indb_keyword_usage` tracking table
  - **Root Cause**: System checked quota limits but never recorded actual usage when keywords were added/removed
  - **Impact**: Users couldn't track their monthly keyword usage against their package limits
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED DATABASE TRIGGER SOLUTION**: Created automated tracking system at database level
  - **Backfill Query**: SQL query to populate `indb_keyword_usage` with current keyword counts per user
  - **Automatic Tracking**: Database triggers that update usage when keywords are added/removed/activated/deactivated
  - **Trigger Function**: `update_keyword_usage()` handles INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations on `indb_keyword_keywords`
  - **User Integration**: Automatic quota limit detection from user packages and subscriptions
- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING COVERAGE**: All keyword operations now update usage automatically
  - **Add Keywords**: `keywords_used` increases automatically when new keywords inserted
  - **Delete Keywords**: `keywords_used` decreases when keywords removed
  - **Activate/Deactivate**: Usage adjusts when `is_active` field changes on existing keywords
  - **Monthly Periods**: Usage tracking follows monthly billing cycles with automatic period management
- ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING**: User verified that keyword usage records now appear correctly
  - **Database Level**: Changes in `indb_keyword_keywords` automatically reflect in `indb_keyword_usage`
  - **No Code Changes**: Solution works without requiring API endpoint modifications
  - **Real-time Updates**: Usage tracking happens immediately when keywords are modified
- **Database Changes Applied**: 
  - Backfill query executed to populate existing user usage
  - Trigger function `update_keyword_usage()` created
  - Triggers applied to `indb_keyword_keywords` table for automatic tracking
- **Result**: Keyword usage tracking now fully functional with automatic database-level synchronization
- **Quota Behavior**: Keywords quota is lifetime allowance per package (no resets) - users get total allowance for package duration

### August 19, 2025 - Critical QueryClient Error Fix After Login Redirect
- ✅ **RESOLVED DASHBOARD LOADING CRASH**: Fixed "No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one" error after login
  - **Issue**: After successful login redirect to `/dashboard`, application crashed with QueryClient error
  - **Root Cause**: Dashboard page component used `useQuery` hooks immediately, but `QueryProvider` only wrapped authenticated content
  - **Timing Problem**: During authentication check phase, `QueryProvider` was not available yet, causing useQuery to fail
  - **Solution**: Moved `QueryProvider` to wrap ALL dashboard content including login page, loading states, and authentication checks
- ✅ **IMPROVED AUTHENTICATION FLOW**: Enhanced dashboard layout to handle all authentication states properly
  - **Universal QueryProvider**: Now wraps all dashboard routes including `/dashboard/login`

### August 20, 2025 - Registration Database Recursion Fix
- ✅ **FIXED REGISTRATION INFINITE RECURSION ERROR**: Resolved database policy conflicts preventing user profile creation
  - **Issue**: Registration failed with "infinite recursion detected in policy" error during profile insertion
  - **Root Cause**: Conflicting RLS policies and manual timestamp insertion interfering with database triggers
  - **Database Schema Confirmed**: `phone_number` and `country` columns already exist in `indb_auth_user_profiles` table
  - **Solution Applied**: Removed manual `created_at` and `updated_at` values to let database defaults handle timestamps
- ✅ **PROVIDED RLS POLICY FIXES**: SQL queries to resolve recursive policy conflicts
  - **Policy Reset**: Commands to drop problematic RLS policies and recreate them properly
  - **Non-Recursive Policies**: New policies using proper `auth.uid()` checks without recursion
  - **Trigger Compatibility**: Ensured compatibility with existing `sync_user_email` and `assign_default_package` triggers
- **Files Modified**: `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Removed manual timestamp insertion
- **Database Changes Required**: SQL queries provided to fix RLS policies and prevent recursion
- **Result**: Registration should now work without database recursion errors when SQL fixes are applied

### August 20, 2025 - Registration Strategy Change: Update Profile After Creation
- ✅ **CHANGED REGISTRATION APPROACH**: Instead of fighting RLS policies, use UPDATE after trigger-created profile
  - **Issue**: Database triggers only populate basic fields (`name`, `email`) during profile creation
  - **Root Problem**: INSERT conflicts with RLS policies and triggers, causing infinite recursion 
  - **New Strategy**: Let triggers create basic profile, then UPDATE with additional fields
  - **Implementation**: Added 500ms delay then UPDATE profile with `phone_number` and `country`
- ✅ **AVOIDED RLS CONFLICTS**: No more INSERT operations that trigger recursion issues
  - **Trigger Flow**: Supabase Auth → Database triggers create profile → UPDATE adds extra fields
  - **Benefits**: Works with existing RLS policies without modification
  - **Safety**: UPDATE operations don't conflict with profile creation triggers
- **Files Modified**: `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Changed from INSERT to UPDATE approach
- **Database Changes**: None required - works with existing triggers and policies
- **Result**: Registration now works with all fields populated without touching RLS or trigger functions

### January 22, 2025 - Fixed Transaction Record Creation Timing
- ✅ **FIXED TRANSACTION NOT FOUND ERROR**: Transaction records now created BEFORE Midtrans API calls
  - **Issue**: Webhook received notifications immediately but transaction record didn't exist yet
  - **Root Cause**: Database INSERT happened AFTER Midtrans API call, creating timing gap
  - **Solution**: Moved transaction record creation to BEFORE `snap.createTransaction()` call
  - **Result**: Transaction record exists when webhook arrives, eliminating "transaction not found" errors
- ✅ **ENHANCED TRANSACTION TRACKING**: Added proper fields for webhook detection
  - **payment_reference**: Set to orderId for webhook lookup
  - **gateway_type**: Set to 'midtrans_snap' for unified webhook payment type detection

### August 28, 2025 - Critical Free Trial Payment Processing Fixes ✅
- ✅ **FIXED SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT ISSUE**: Resolved critical bug where trial subscriptions used $1 instead of real package price
  - **Problem**: When users started a trial for Pro ($45), the charge was correctly $1 for tokenization, but the subscription was also created with $1 instead of $45
  - **Root Cause**: Midtrans recurring handler was using `amount.finalAmount` for both charge and subscription creation
  - **Solution**: Enhanced handler to use `amount.originalAmount` for trial subscriptions (real package price) and `1` only for the initial charge
  - **Technical Fix**: Added subscription amount debug logging to track charge vs subscription amounts correctly
- ✅ **ELIMINATED DOUBLE REQUEST ISSUE**: Fixed duplicate payment processing causing multiple subscription creation attempts
  - **Problem**: Payment system was making two separate requests for same transaction, creating duplicate processing
  - **Root Cause**: Main payment handler attempted subscription creation, then 3DS callback also tried to create subscription
  - **Solution**: Modified flow so subscription is only created in 3DS callback after successful authentication, not in main handler
  - **Logic Improvement**: Main handler now only handles charge and 3DS setup, leaving subscription creation to callback
- ✅ **ENHANCED 3DS CALLBACK TRIAL HANDLING**: Updated 3DS callback to properly handle trial-specific logic
  - **Trial Amount Detection**: Added logic to detect trial transactions and use real package price for subscription
  - **Trial Subscription Naming**: Enhanced subscription naming for trials (e.g., "PRO_TRIAL_AUTO_BILLING")
  - **Trial Billing Schedule**: Implemented proper 3-day delay for trial subscriptions vs immediate billing for regular
  - **Trial User Profile**: Added trial-specific user profile updates with trial status, dates, and billing configuration
- ✅ **IMPROVED PAYMENT FLOW DEBUG LOGGING**: Added comprehensive debug logging for payment processing
  - **Amount Tracking**: Clear logging of charge amount vs subscription amount for trials
  - **Trial Detection**: Visible logging when trial parameters are detected and processed
  - **Flow Tracking**: Better visibility into payment processing stages and decision points
  - **Error Prevention**: Enhanced logging to prevent future confusion between charge and subscription amounts
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/api/billing/channels/midtrans-recurring/handler.ts`: Fixed subscription amount calculation for trials
  - `app/api/billing/midtrans-3ds-callback/route.ts`: Enhanced trial handling in 3DS callback with proper amount detection
- **Result**: Free trial system now correctly charges $1 for tokenization but creates subscriptions with real package price ($45 for Pro), eliminating double requests and ensuring proper trial-to-paid conversion

### August 28, 2025 - Trial Monitoring Job Implementation & Critical Expired Trial Fix ✅
- ✅ **IDENTIFIED CRITICAL TRIAL MONITORING ISSUE**: Discovered trial monitoring service existed but was NOT running automatically
  - **Problem Identified**: Users were keeping their Pro/Premium package access after trial ended, even when trial expired
  - **Root Cause**: Trial monitor was only updating trial_status to 'ended' but NOT removing package_id for auto-billing enabled trials
  - **Expected Behavior**: When trial ends, user should have NO package assignment until Midtrans webhook confirms successful payment
  - **Fixed Logic**: All expired trials now remove package_id, subscribed_at, and expires_at immediately when trial ends
  - **Payment Restoration**: Only when Midtrans webhook processes successful payment will user regain package access
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AUTOMATED TRIAL MONITORING JOB SYSTEM**: Added missing trial monitoring to background worker startup
  - **Created Trial Monitor Job** (`lib/job-management/trial-monitor-job.ts`): Scheduled job that runs every 15 minutes to process expired trials
  - **Enhanced Worker Startup** (`lib/job-management/worker-startup.ts`): Added trial monitoring initialization to background worker system
  - **Automatic Trial Processing**: System now automatically finds and processes expired trials every 15 minutes
  - **Unified Logic**: Both auto_billing_enabled true/false trials now remove access when expired
  - **Clean State**: Users return to no-package state after trial ends, regardless of auto-billing setting
  - **Proper Flow**: Trial End → No Access → Midtrans Payment Success → Access Restored
  - **User Experience**: Clear distinction between trial period and paid subscription
- ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY PROCESSED USER'S EXPIRED TRIAL**: Fixed specific user issue where trial remained active after expiration
  - **User Data Before Fix**: user_id `915f50e5-0902-466a-b1af-bdf19d789722` had package_id assigned to Pro package despite trial_ends_at being past
  - **Processing Result**: Successfully found 1 expired trial, removed package access, set package_id to null
  - **Expected Database State**: User should now have trial_status: 'ended', package_id: null, subscribed_at: null, expires_at: null
  - **Manual Trigger**: Used admin API to immediately process expired trials instead of waiting for scheduled run
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `lib/job-management/trial-monitor-job.ts`: New scheduled job class for automated trial monitoring every 15 minutes
  - `lib/job-management/worker-startup.ts`: Enhanced to include trial monitoring initialization in background workers
- **Result**: Trial monitoring system now runs automatically every 15 minutes, ensuring users lose package access immediately when trials expire, with seamless restoration only upon successful payment confirmation

### January 31, 2025 - Order ID System Analysis Complete ✅

- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE ORDER ID ANALYSIS COMPLETED**: Deep dive analysis of order ID generation, usage, and database structure throughout the entire IndexNow Studio codebase

**Order ID Generation Systems Identified**:

1. **Midtrans Create Payment API** (`app/api/v1/billing/midtrans/create-payment/route.ts`):
   - **Pattern**: `ORDER-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9).toUpperCase()}`
   - **Example**: `ORDER-1756712973275-XK9P2M7NQ`
   - **Usage**: Main entry point for Midtrans payments
   - **Database Storage**: Stored as `payment_reference` in `indb_payment_transactions`

2. **Midtrans Snap Handler** (`app/api/v1/billing/channels/midtrans-snap/handler.ts`):
   - **Pattern**: `SNAP-${Date.now()}-${user_id.slice(0, 8)}`
   - **Example**: `SNAP-1756712973275-915f50e5`
   - **Usage**: Dedicated Snap payment channel handler
   - **Database Storage**: Stored as `payment_reference` in `indb_payment_transactions`

3. **Core Payment Processor** (`lib/services/payments/core/PaymentProcessor.ts`):
   - **Pattern**: `${method}_${userPrefix}_${timestamp}`
   - **Example**: `CRED_915f50e5_1756712973275`
   - **Usage**: Generic payment processing system
   - **Method Processing**: Payment method normalized to 4-char uppercase code

**Database Schema - `indb_payment_transactions` Table**:
- **Primary Key**: `id` (UUID) - Internal transaction identifier
- **Order Reference**: `payment_reference` (TEXT) - Stores the generated order ID
- **Gateway ID**: `gateway_transaction_id` (TEXT) - External gateway transaction reference
- **Unique Constraint**: Order IDs are unique through timestamp + random generation

**Order ID Flow Analysis**:

1. **Creation Flow**:
   ```
   User Places Order → Generate Unique Order ID → Store as payment_reference → Send to Gateway
   ```

2. **Reference Flow**:
   ```
   Gateway Response → Update gateway_transaction_id → Query by payment_reference for order lookup
   ```

3. **Query Patterns Found**:
   - **By Order ID**: `.eq('payment_reference', order_id)` - Primary lookup method
   - **By Transaction ID**: `.eq('id', transaction_id)` - Internal record lookup
   - **By Gateway ID**: `.eq('gateway_transaction_id', gateway_id)` - Gateway callback queries

**Inconsistencies Identified**:
- **Mixed Terminology**: Some code uses `order_id`, others use `payment_reference`, some use `transaction_id`
- **Response Mapping**: Billing history API maps `payment_reference` to `order_id` in transformation layer
- **Database vs API**: Database uses `payment_reference` but API responses use `order_id` for consistency

**Critical Files Using Order IDs**:
- **Payment Creation**: `app/api/v1/billing/midtrans/create-payment/route.ts`
- **Order Lookup**: `app/api/v1/billing/orders/[order_id]/route.ts`
- **Billing History**: `app/api/v1/billing/history/route.ts`
- **Admin Orders**: `app/api/v1/admin/orders/route.ts` and `app/api/v1/admin/orders/[id]/route.ts`
- **Payment Channels**: All handlers in `app/api/v1/billing/channels/`
- **Webhook Processing**: `app/api/v1/billing/midtrans-3ds-callback/route.ts`

**Uniqueness Guarantee**:
- **Timestamp Component**: `Date.now()` ensures chronological uniqueness  
- **Random Component**: Additional entropy prevents collisions within same millisecond
- **Prefix Component**: Different prefixes (`ORDER-`, `SNAP-`) allow system identification
- **User Component**: Some patterns include user ID for additional context

**Metadata Storage**:
- **transaction.metadata.midtrans_order_id**: Backup storage of order ID
- **transaction.gateway_response.order_id**: Gateway-specific order ID storage
- **transaction.metadata.customer_info**: Customer details linked to order

**Status Tracking**:
- Orders tracked through `transaction_status` field: `pending` → `completed`/`failed`
- Status updates logged in `indb_payment_transactions_history` table
- Admin panel allows manual status updates via `/api/v1/admin/orders/[id]/status/route.ts`

**Analysis Summary**:
- Order IDs are properly unique and systematically generated
- Multiple generation patterns exist for different payment channels
- Database consistently uses `payment_reference` as the canonical order ID field
- API layer provides consistent `order_id` mapping for frontend consumption
- System properly handles gateway callbacks and order status tracking

## Recent Changes



### September 04, 2025 - Template Logic PGRST116 Database Errors Fixed ✅

### September 04, 2025 - Template UI & Public Page Access Fixed ✅

- 🔧 **TEMPLATE UI COMPLETELY REMOVED**: Eliminated template selection UI and backend logic
  - **Issue**: Template selector was still visible in admin backend despite being simplified to default only
  - **Root Cause**: Form schema, API routes, and UI components still contained template references
  - **Solution**: Removed template field from PageFormSchema, API routes, and form components
  
- 🌐 **PUBLIC PAGE ACCESS FIXED**: Resolved middleware blocking public CMS pages
  - **Issue**: Created CMS pages required login to access, blocking public visitors
  - **Root Cause**: Middleware was restricting all routes except specific publicRoutes array
  - **Solution**: Changed middleware to only restrict /dashboard routes, allowing all other pages to be public
  
- ✅ **BACKEND TEMPLATE LOGIC REMOVED**:
  - **PageFormSchema**: Removed `template: z.enum(['default']).default('default')` field completely
  - **PageForm Component**: Removed template from defaultValues and hidden input field
  - **API Routes**: Updated POST/PUT routes to hardcode `template: 'default'` in database operations
  - **Middleware**: Changed from whitelist approach to blacklist approach for route restrictions
  
- 🎯 **RESULTS**: Clean admin interface and proper public access
  - **Admin UI**: No more confusing template selector in page creation/editing
  - **Public Access**: CMS pages now accessible without login (e.g., /privacy-policy, /about)
  - **Database**: Template field still exists in DB but hardcoded to 'default' for consistency



- 🔧 **CRITICAL DATABASE ERRORS RESOLVED**: Fixed PGRST116 "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned" errors
  - **Root Cause**: `getPageBySlug` function in `app/(public)/[slug]/page.tsx` was missing `published_at` filter, causing queries to fail when no published pages existed
  - **Template Logic Simplified**: Removed complex template enum validation that conflicted with simplified schema
  - **Issue**: Database queries using `.single()` were failing when no matching records found due to incomplete filtering
  
- ✅ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**:
  - **Database Query Fixed**: Added `.not('published_at', 'is', null)` filter to `getPageBySlug` function to match API route pattern
  - **Template Validation Simplified**: Updated `lib/cms/pageValidation.ts` to only support 'default' template, removing conflicting multi-template logic
  - **Consistent Filtering**: Ensured page queries filter by both `status = 'published'` AND `published_at IS NOT NULL`
  
- 🎯 **RESULT**: All page routing now works correctly without database errors
  - **Before**: PGRST116 errors on every page load attempt
  - **After**: Clean page loading with proper 404 handling for non-existent pages
  - **Performance**: Homepage loads in ~341ms, dynamic pages load in ~900ms


### September 04, 2025 - Login Route Redirect Elimination ✅

- 🔧 **LOGIN ROUTING FIXED**: Eliminated all `/login` redirects to ensure direct `/auth/login` routing
  - **Issue**: Sign In button in header was still redirecting to `/login` which then redirected to `/auth/login`
  - **Root Cause**: `handleAuthAction` function in `hooks/shared/usePageData.ts` was using `/login` instead of `/auth/login`
  - **Solution**: Updated `handleAuthAction` to redirect directly to `/auth/login` for unauthenticated users
  - **Middleware Updated**: Removed `/login` from public routes list since the route no longer exists
  
- ✅ **CHANGES IMPLEMENTED**:
  - **Fixed**: `hooks/shared/usePageData.ts` line 46: `'/login'` → `'/auth/login'`
  - **Updated**: `middleware.ts` removed `/login` from `publicRoutes` array
  - **Verified**: No `/login` directory exists, all login references now point to `/auth/login`
  
- 🎯 **RESULT**: Users clicking Sign In button now go directly to `/auth/login` without any redirects
  - **Before**: Sign In → `/login` → redirect to `/auth/login` (2 requests)
  - **After**: Sign In → `/auth/login` (1 direct request)

### September 04, 2025 - Multi-Category Support Database Fix 🔧

- ⚠️ **DATABASE FIX REQUIRED**: Identified missing `categories` column in `indb_cms_posts` table causing update failures
  - **Issue**: CMS post updates failing with "Could not find the 'categories' column" error (PGRST204)
  - **Root Cause**: Backend code expects `categories` JSONB column to store array of category IDs, but column doesn't exist in database
  - **Impact**: Users cannot create or update posts with multiple categories
  
- 🔧 **SOLUTION PROVIDED**: SQL query to add missing `categories` column:
  ```sql
  -- Add categories column to store array of category IDs
  ALTER TABLE public.indb_cms_posts 
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS categories jsonb DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;
  
  -- Add index for better performance on categories queries
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_indb_cms_posts_categories 
  ON public.indb_cms_posts USING gin (categories);
  ```

- 📋 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**:
  - **Current Structure**: Posts table has `category` (text) and `main_category_id` (uuid) columns
  - **Missing Component**: `categories` JSONB array to store multiple category IDs for multi-category support
  - **Code Ready**: Backend API already implements multi-category logic, just needs database column
  - **Performance**: GIN index added for efficient JSONB array queries
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing single category support while adding multi-category functionality

- 🎯 **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Run the provided SQL in Supabase SQL Editor to resolve the issue

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Multi-category support now fully operational with proper database schema

### September 04, 2025 - Category Column Cleanup Complete ✅

  - **Solution**: Removed text `category` column, kept `main_category_id` (UUID) and `categories` (JSONB array)
  - **Optimal Structure**: Now uses proper relational design with category table joins

- 🔧 **CODE REFACTORING COMPLETE**: Updated all API routes and components to use category relationships
  - **Blog Posts API**: Modified to join with `indb_cms_categories` table to get category slug from `main_category_id`
  - **Single Post API**: Updated to fetch category slug via relationship instead of deleted text field
  - **Admin CMS API**: Removed references to deleted category column in create/update operations
  - **PostForm Component**: Cleaned up validation schema and form handling to use new category structure
  - **URL Routing**: Maintained `/blog/{category}/{slug}` structure using joined category slug
