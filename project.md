### Key Features
- **Automated Google Indexing**: Submit thousands of URLs to Google's Indexing API automatically
- **Multi-Service Account Management**: Load balance across multiple Google service accounts
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Support for one-time, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly indexing jobs
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time job tracking, quota monitoring, and detailed analytics
- **Professional Email Notifications**: Branded email reports for job completion, failures, and quota alerts
- **Enterprise Security**: Role-based access control, input validation, and security auditing

## CRITICAL PROJECT CAUTIONS - ALWAYS REMEMBER

1. **Next.js ONLY** - This project uses Next.js with NO VITE. Never suggest or implement Vite migration.
2. **Supabase Self-Hosted** - Database is hosted at https://base.indexnow.studio
   - Do NOT install PostgreSQL locally
   - Do NOT push database changes locally
   - For any database updates/changes/additions/removals, provide SQL queries for user to run in Supabase SQL Editor
   - You must be follow this prefix "indb_{collections}_{table-name}" "collections" is like same collections, for example like "security" collection which have tables "indb_security_event", "indb_security_log" and so-on.
3. **Project Color Scheme ONLY** - Use ONLY this project's color scheme:
   - Background: #FFFFFF (Pure White), #F7F9FC (Light Gray)

## Current Database Schema (Supabase Tables)
If an updates affectig the database and RLS. You need to provide the SQL Query for me to run in Supabase SQL Editor. Keep in mind that to make new tables, you must be follow this prefix "indb_{collections}_{table-name}" "collections" is like same collections, for example like "security" collection which have tables "indb_security_event", "indb_security_log" and so-on.

All tables use `indb_` prefix and are located at https://base.indexnow.studio:

**SITEMAP URL PROCESSING BUG FIXED - CRITICAL BACKEND PROCESSING ISSUE RESOLVED (January 27, 2025)** 
- ✅ **IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE OF SITEMAP JOB FAILURES**: Found critical property name mismatch in sitemap URL processing
  - **Database Schema**: Jobs store sitemap URL as `sitemap_url` (snake_case) in `source_data` JSONB column
  - **Frontend API**: Correctly sends `sitemapUrl` (camelCase) and API converts to `sitemap_url` when saving
  - **Processing Bug**: GoogleIndexingProcessor was looking for `sitemapUrl` instead of `sitemap_url` causing "No sitemap URL found" errors
- ✅ **FIXED GOOGLE INDEXING PROCESSOR**: Updated URL extraction logic to use correct property name

  - **Consistency**: Both processing paths now use identical sitemap parsing logic
- ✅ **VERIFIED SITEMAP COMPATIBILITY**: Tested with user's actual sitemap URL `https://nexjob.tech/sitemap-loker-1.xml`
  - **Valid XML Structure**: Confirmed sitemap uses standard XML format with `<urlset>` and `<url>` entries
  - **URL Format**: Each URL entry contains `<loc>`, `<lastmod>`, `<changefreq>`, and `<priority>` elements
  - **Parser Support**: XML parser correctly handles this format and extracts all job listing URLs

**LANDING PAGE DATABASE INTEGRATION FIXED - REAL PRICING DATA CONNECTED (January 27, 2025)**
