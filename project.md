# IndexNow Pro - Project Updates & Changes Log

## August 11, 2025 - Migration & Initial Setup

### 18:00 - Replit Environment Migration
- Successfully migrated project from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment
- Installed all required dependencies: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Supabase libraries, UI components
- Verified Next.js configuration with proper Replit domain allowances and security headers
- Confirmed background services initialize properly: job monitor, quota reset monitor, WebSocket services
- Application running successfully on port 5000 with all core systems operational

### 18:05 - Project Cleanup
- Removed unnecessary test-login directory as requested by user
- Updated progress tracker to reflect completed migration tasks

### 18:10 - Documentation Error Resolution
- User reported replit.md content was incorrectly shortened during migration
- Attempted to restore full documentation but continued to have permission issues
- User created project.md as dedicated file for all future updates and changes
- Will use project.md exclusively for all future development updates and timeline tracking

### 18:15 - Documentation Structure Clarification
- User clarified that all updates should go in project.md file, not replit.md
- replit.md should never be modified - it contains the master project documentation
- project.md is the dedicated file for all development updates and timeline tracking

### 18:20 - Corrected Documentation Mistake
- Accidentally modified replit.md by adding Recent Changes section
- Immediately reverted replit.md back to original state
- Confirmed: replit.md should NEVER be modified under any circumstances
- All future updates will only go in project.md

### Current Status
- Application fully operational on Replit environment
- All core systems functioning: authentication, background workers, API endpoints
- Ready to receive specific problem identification for Keyword Tracker feature fixes
