## C. Subscriptions and Billing

**1. Subscription Plans**

The Service offers multiple subscription plans with different features, quotas, and pricing tiers. These include keyword tracking limits, domain monitoring quotas, indexing request allowances, and support levels. Current plans and pricing are displayed on our pricing page and may be updated from time to time. Your subscription includes access to features according to your selected plan's specifications.

**2. Billing and Payment**

Subscription fees are charged in advance on a recurring basis according to your selected billing cycle (monthly, quarterly, biannual, or annual). Payment is due immediately upon subscription or renewal. We accept various payment methods as indicated during checkout. All prices are displayed in your local currency when available, and currency conversion rates may apply.

**3. Automatic Renewal**

Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel before the renewal date. Renewal charges will be processed using your stored payment method. You will be charged the then-current subscription rate, which may differ from your original rate.

**4. Price Changes**

We reserve the right to modify subscription prices at any time. Price changes will not affect your current billing cycle but will apply to subsequent renewals. We will provide reasonable advance notice of price changes through email or Service notifications.

**5. Trial Periods**

We may offer free trial periods for new users. Trial subscriptions will automatically convert to paid subscriptions unless canceled before the trial expires. Credit card information is required to start a trial to prevent abuse and ensure service continuity.

**6. Refund Policy**

We offer refunds according to the following policy:

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- **First Invoice Only**: Refunds apply only to the first subscription payment (not renewals). Subsequent renewals are non-refundable.
- **New Subscriptions**: Full refund within 30 days of initial purchase
- **One Refund per Customer**: Each customer is eligible for a refund once. Accounts created to circumvent this policy will not be refunded.
- **Trial Period Exclusion**: Refunds are not available for users who have already used a free trial.

**Refund Categories:**
- **New Subscriptions**: Full refund within 30 days of initial purchase for first-time customers
- **Renewals**: Non-refundable - refunds do not apply to subscription renewals
- **Usage-based charges**: Non-refundable as they reflect actual service consumption
- **Partial periods**: No refunds for partial billing periods

**Refund Request Process:**
To process a refund request, you must contact our support team from the email address associated with your account and provide your subscription ID or recent invoice number. We may require additional details to verify ownership of the account.

**Anti-Abuse Policy:**
We provide refunds only once per customer. Creating multiple accounts, using the same payment details, or otherwise attempting to circumvent this policy constitutes abuse, and we reserve the right to deny refunds in such cases. We reserve the right to refuse a refund if we determine the account has been misused or abused, including but not limited to users detected signing up multiple times with the same or different email addresses.

**7. Account Suspension for Non-Payment**

Accounts with overdue payments may be suspended, limiting access to the Service. We will make reasonable efforts to collect payment before suspension. Suspended accounts may be terminated if payment is not received within a reasonable period.
