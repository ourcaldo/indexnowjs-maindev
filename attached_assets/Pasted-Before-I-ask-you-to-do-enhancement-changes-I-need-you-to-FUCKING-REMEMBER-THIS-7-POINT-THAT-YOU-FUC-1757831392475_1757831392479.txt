Before I ask you to do enhancement/changes, I need you to FUCKING REMEMBER THIS 7 POINT THAT YOU FUCKING STILL MISS IT.
1. Deep dive into this project, read all code, file and information, specificly in project.md (not replit.md, but still read the replit.md) where you can get the all related this project, database structure and detailed changes log. Don't just fucking use grep to get few lines to read it, fucking open the file and read the full context.
2. Always and keep remember that you're SHOULDN'T delete any information in project.md, for every update and changes, you should write in Recent Changes inside the project.md with proper timeline format like the other without delete anything.
3. If you need to make debug/test file to fix the problem, then make it. But keep in mind to delete that file again after it's solved and before you end the action chain.
4. For after every changes you made, don't forget to add it in timeline changlongs in project.md in Recent Changes section.
5. As this project using Supabase database, which you didn't have access directly to it, if you need to know the database format beside that I put in project.md, you can give me SQL queries for me to run to see, changes or update database related. Keep in your mind to not push anything related to DB in your local.
6. If you need to add debug, never use console.log that can appear on user's browser, we don't want that.
7. New features or any that I ask must be good refactoed code, not single code that handle all functions.

Before, I asked you to made a plan to enhance the color and organization and you made the plan on file ./COLOR_CSS_ORGANIZATION_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md and I also already ask you to do the implementation of Phase 1 to the Phase 3 (partial).

Now, please do deep dive for the codebase and the plan, and continue the implementation of Phase 3. As I remember, you just implement the Phase 3 only in authentication page, but please check for it.

Before you do it, if you need information, feel free to ask me, and just reminding, keep in mind to:
1. If you found a hardcoded color in a single file, change it to color from global.css (color/elements). If the global.css didn't have that color/elements, then made new one and use it.
2. Make sure the organization is good standarized for UX/UI for better enhancement in the future. As I'm not developer, so I need you to handle it. I didn't know good organization is per component or page or what. So please just make it good.
