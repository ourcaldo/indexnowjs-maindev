Before I ask you to do enhancement/changes, I need you to FUCKING REMEMBER THIS 7 POINT THAT YOU FUCKING STILL MISS IT.
1. Deep dive into this project, read all code, file and information, specificly in project.md (not replit.md, but still read the replit.md) where you can get the all related this project, database structure and detailed changes log. Don't just fucking use grep to get few lines to read it, fucking open the file and read the full context.
2. Always and keep remember that you're SHOULDN'T delete any information in project.md, for every update and changes, you should write in Recent Changes inside the project.md with proper timeline format like the other without delete anything.
3. If you need to make debug/test file to fix the problem, then make it. But keep in mind to delete that file again after it's solved and before you end the action chain.
4. For after every changes you made, don't forget to add it in timeline changlongs in project.md in Recent Changes section.
5. As this project using Supabase database, which you didn't have access directly to it, if you need to know the database format beside that I put in project.md, you can give me SQL queries for me to run to see, changes or update database related. Keep in your mind to not push anything related to DB in your local.
6. If you need to add debug, never use console.log that can appear on user's browser, we don't want that.
7. New features or any that I ask must be good refactoed code, not single code that handle all functions.

Before, I asked you to do deep dive about the react components library that you're using in this project. After analysis and compare to several open sources, we'll keep to use the Shacdn/ui.

Now, related to the improvement. I want you to revamp the main user dashboard to achive this goals:
1. Make the user dashboard looks profesional
2. Have good color-contrast
3. More informational and helping user by adding new information/widget like for example (not a must, you can't create a widget, cards, chart in every part of revamped dashboard) chart, analytics, and so-on
4. Make the user dashboard more compact and user friendly

To achive the goals, I give you permission and ask you to:
1. Edit, add or modify current layout, widget, elements or any part that in user dashboard to achive the goals
2. Make sure that the Shacdn is used and not mixed with other react library (don't mixed if it's not an urgent)
3. Make sure there's no hardcoded like color, scheme, or any hardcoded that prevent future-updates. If you found in the current dashboard, please delete it.
4. Make sure that the new revamped dashboard is user and mobile friendly.
5. Make sure that the dashboard still and must have good structure and good refactored. I don't want single file that handle all the things.
6. Related to color scheme, make sure that it's using the style.css, not hardcoded color in the dashboard.
7. Don't made new/duplicated components if we already made before.
8. This is based on feedback in your progress before, if you're using border in cards, never use bold border in just 1 side. made the border same, still use the border, but don't bold it in just 1 side
9. Make any elements based on what this project have, DON'T made it if the project's didn't have the features, for example like login with google, integrate with Google Search Console and so-on.

For this revamped, I want you to revamp login and sign up page which the current is already satisfied for me. But, the right column is have more than 1 images that show using carousel which I want you to enhance it by:
Change all slideshow images, using 1 images that looks like this project dashboard, make it compact and highlight the IndexNow Rank Tracker
