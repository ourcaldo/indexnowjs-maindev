Before I ask you to do enhancement/changes, I need you to FUCKING REMEMBER THIS 7 POINT THAT YOU FUCKING STILL MISS IT.
1. Deep dive into this project, read all code, file and information, specificly in project.md (not replit.md, but still read the replit.md) where you can get the all related this project, database structure and detailed changes log. Don't just fucking use grep to get few lines to read it, fucking open the file and read the full context.
2. Always and keep remember that you're SHOULDN'T delete any information in project.md, for every update and changes, you should write in Recent Changes inside the project.md with proper timeline format like the other without delete anything.
3. If you need to make debug/test file to fix the problem, then make it. But keep in mind to delete that file again after it's solved and before you end the action chain.
4. For after every changes you made, don't forget to add it in timeline changlongs in project.md in Recent Changes section.
5. As this project using Supabase database, which you didn't have access directly to it, if you need to know the database format beside that I put in project.md, you can give me SQL queries for me to run to see, changes or update database related. Keep in your mind to not push anything related to DB in your local.
6. If you need to add debug, never use console.log that can appear on user's browser, we don't want that.
7. New features or any that I ask must be good refactoed code, not single code that handle all functions.

Now, related to the user dashboard when the dashboard is loaded almost in every page it's called multiple API endpoint. Bcs of that, the page load seems to slow.

So, I need you to add another api endpoint and merge the multiple APIs without deleting the single API endpoint, so the API calls will be give response something like this:
{
  "user": {
    "profile": { "id": "123", "email": "user@email.com", "name": "John Doe" },
    "quota": { "used": 120, "limit": 500 },
    "settings": { "timezone": "UTC" },
    "trial": { "eligible": false, "status": "expired" }
  },
  "billing": {
    "overview": { "plan": "Pro", "renewalDate": "2025-09-30" },
    "history": [
      { "id": "tx_001", "amount": 49, "date": "2025-08-01" }
    ]
  },
  "indexing": {
    "recentJobs": [
      { "id": "job_001", "status": "completed" }
    ],
    "serviceAccounts": 2
  },
  "rankTracking": {
    "usage": { "keywords": 130, "limit": 500 },
    "recentHistory": [
      { "keyword": "seo tools", "rank": 5 }
    ]
  },
  "notifications": [
    { "id": "n1", "message": "Quota low", "type": "warning" }
  ]
}

The API that you need to merge are this:

For user dashboard with new endpoint is /api/v1/dashboard:
1. /api/v1/rank-tracking/keyword-usage
2. /api/v1/rank-tracking/domains
3. /api/v1/auth/user/profile
4. /api/v1/auth/user/trial-eligibility
5. /api/v1/auth/user/quota
6. /api/v1/notifications/service-account-quota
7. /api/v1/rank-tracking/keyword-usage
8. /api/v1/billing/packages
9. /api/v1/auth/user/settings

After you made the merge, please make sure that the dashboard is called the merge API endpoint for the right place and didn't call the single APIs endpoint. For some part, we may still need to call the single API endpoint as it's have more dedicated jobs.
It's your jobs to make sure which things that need to calls single APIs and which part that can call the merge API.

But, there's still some API endpoint that being called in single call, when I access the dashboard this is some API endpoint that being called in single:
1. /api/v1/rank-tracking/keyword-usage
2.
