I understand exactly what you want. Let me fix the /verify page design and security issues:

Design: Change from single column to 2-column layout like login/signup (no cards)
Security: Only allow logged-in, unverified users to access /verify
URL: Change from ?email= to ?goto= parameter like Replit
Let me start by examining the current code and then implementing the changes:


Decided on verify page structure (7 seconds)
Now I'll implement the fixes. Let me create a new 2-column verify page with proper security and use ?goto= parameter like Replit:


Planned login and register parameter changes

Check logged-in users can verify.

Redesign verify page layout.

Change URL parameter name.

Decided on redirect parameter usage
Now I need to update the login and register flows to use the ?goto= parameter:


Planned register page redirect logic
Let me search for where the register page redirects to verify:


Searched for "Find where register page redirects to /verify or mentions verify redirect after successful registration"

Decided on register page behavior
It looks like the register page doesn't automatically redirect to /verify - it just shows a success message. That's fine, as users need to check their email first after registration. The login page changes are what we needed.

Let me test the new verify page and complete the task:


Update sign-in flows to use parameter.

Reviewed verify page changes

Reviewed /verify page redesign

Addressed open redirect vulnerability
Excellent catch by the architect! There's a critical security flaw - an open redirect vulnerability through the goto parameter. An attacker could redirect users to external malicious sites. Let me fix this immediately:


Edited app/verify/page.tsx

Decided on redirect sanitization strategy (4 seconds)
Now let me check if there are any other references to the old ?email= parameter that need to be updated:


Decided on documentation updates
The old ?email= references are only in documentation files, not in the actual code. Let me test the application to ensure everything is working correctly with the security fix:

Checked logs

Decided on verify page functionality
Let me take a screenshot to see how the new verify page looks and ensure it's working correctly:


Took a screenshot

Confirmed security vulnerability fix

Fix unsafe redirection security issue

Check new page design and security

Decided on verify page redesign (6 seconds)
âœ… Verify Page Redesign Complete!
I've successfully redesigned the /verify page to match your requirements:

ðŸ”’ Security Fixed
Authentication Gating: Now only accessible to logged-in users with unverified emails
Redirect Protection: Added validation to prevent malicious external redirects
Access Control:
Not logged in â†’ redirects to /login
Already verified â†’ redirects to dashboard
Not verified â†’ shows verify page
ðŸŽ¨ Design Updated
2-Column Layout: Left side has verify form, right side shows dashboard preview (like login/signup)
Mobile Responsive: Single column on mobile, 2-column on desktop
Professional UI: Matches your existing login/signup design without cards
ðŸ”— URL Parameter Changed
Before: /verify?email=user@example.com (exposed email, accessible to anyone)
After: /verify?goto=/dashboard (secure, Replit-style)
ðŸ”„ Updated Flow
Login with unverified email â†’ /verify?goto=/dashboard
After verification â†’ redirects to destination (dashboard or custom goto)
Clean, secure redirect handling
The page now works exactly like Replit's verify page - secure, professional, and user-friendly!
