Before I ask you to do enhancement/changes, I need you to do:
1. Deep dive into this project, read all code, file and information, specificly in project.md (not replit.md, but still read the replit.md) where you can get the all related this project, database structure and detailed changes log.
2. Always and keep remember that you're SHOULDN'T delete any information in project.md, for every update and changes, you should write in Recent Changes inside the project.md with proper timeline format like the other without delete anything.
3. If you need to make debug/test file to fix the problem, then make it. But keep in mind to delete that file again after it's solved and before you end the action chain.
4. For after every changes you made, don't forget to add it in timeline changlongs in project.md in Recent Changes section.
5. As this project using Supabase database, which you didn't have access directly to it, if you need to know the database format beside that I put in project.md, you can give me SQL queries for me to run to see, changes or update database related. Keep in your mind to not push anything related to DB in your local.

Then, as you can see we already have payment gateway which the current payment gateway is using Bank Transfer and manual confirmation.
The payment gateway setting is on admin backend which is backend/admin/settings/payments. 

For this time, I want you to add another payment gateway which is Midtrans (recurring debut/credit card) so user can made a paymen using their cards and will be auto recurring.

First, in the backend admin, please made a section inside payment gateway, so I can add Midtrans with their credentials merchant ID, clientkey and server key and type (Production/Sandbox).

After that, please read the documentation for API subscription in file "midtrans-subscribtion.md" which I copy it from Midtrans documentation https://docs.midtrans.com/reference/api-methods-1.

Just for information, midtrans is only accept payment in IDR/Rupiah, so for payment in usd, we must be convert it to IDR first.
