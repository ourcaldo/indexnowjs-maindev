Before I ask you to do enhancement/changes, I need you to do:
1. Deep dive into this project, read all code, file and information, specificly in project.md (not replit.md, but still read the replit.md) where you can get the all related this project, database structure and detailed changes log.
2. Always and keep remember that you're SHOULDN'T delete any information in project.md, for every update and changes, you should write in Recent Changes inside the project.md with proper timeline format like the other without delete anything.
3. If you need to make debug/test file to fix the problem, then make it. But keep in mind to delete that file again after it's solved and before you end the action chain.
4. For after every changes you made, don't forget to add it in timeline changlongs in project.md in Recent Changes section.
5. As this project using Supabase database, which you didn't have access directly to it, if you need to know the database format beside that I put in project.md, you can give me SQL queries for me to run to see, changes or update database related. Keep in your mind to not push anything related to DB in your local.

Before, we already made a plan to enhance payment API and checkout page and flow. Then, we made the plan in file ./CHECKOUT_PAYMENT_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md.

As we already do the Phase 1 (Prio 0) and Phase 2 (Prio 1), now it's time to move to the Phase 3 (Prio 2), which is:
Phase 3 (P2) - Week 3
1. Create Billing Period Selector Component
2. Update Order Summary Component
3. Test period selection functionality

Before you do the enhancement, I want you to keep in mind that:
1. We're using multiple currency with default currency is USD. Currency is based on user country in profiles tables.
2. The payment (Midtrans Recurring and SNAP), is only can do transaction in IDR, so we need to make sure that the transaction is do in IDR and we need to convert the currency to IDR when made API request
3. We have multiple periods with pricing tiers, so you must get the pricing in tables "indb_payment_packages" column "pricing_tiers" like this one: {"annual": {"IDR": {"promo_price": 120000, "period_label": "12 Months", "regular_price": 600000}, "USD": {"promo_price": 159, "period_label": "12 Months", "regular_price": 199}}, "monthly": {"IDR": {"promo_price": 25000, "period_label": "Monthly", "regular_price": 50000}, "USD": {"promo_price": 15, "period_label": "Monthly", "regular_price": 19}}, "biannual": {"IDR": {"promo_price": 150000, "period_label": "6 Months", "regular_price": 300000}, "USD": {"promo_price": 84, "period_label": "6 Months", "regular_price": 108}}, "quarterly": {"IDR": {"promo_price": 60000, "period_label": "3 Months", "regular_price": 150000}, "USD": {"promo_price": 45, "period_label": "3 Months", "regular_price": 57}}}
4. In period selector that you will made, please start to monthly to annual
5. Order summary, please also add the conversion rate and the IDR that they will pay if the pricing are in USD

On the another part, I want you to bit revamp the checkout page, but make sure it's not affecting the current flow and other code like Payment API. The new revamp must be clean and simple, please see the reference that I give on the images.

Before you do a changes, I want you to give list what you need to do after you read this instruction.
