Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

Before I want you to more in-deepth about this project. Please take time to read all information in replit.md because there's a lot important things (from database to all changelogs) that you should know.

There's an error when I open admin dashboard when I open single order menu, which the error is regarding syntax error. This error is still appear even when we do some changes and fix.

Now, please do deep dive in single order page in admin dashboard and fix this issue now.
