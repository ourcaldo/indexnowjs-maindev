 At the first place, I ask you to make the activity logs like this: "Activity Logs: Track backend events, user actions (logins, changes, API calls), and system warnings or errors for audits and debugging."

But, the actual you're just make the activity log for the admin user, which what admin super do while in admin dashboard. 

So, I need you to change, fix and enhance it. I want you to make sure that the activity logs is record all user and all activity which also display the user name and also have single activity detail when we click it will have single page (when user is clicked, it's redirected to single user detail, we already have this single page under user management but didn't have the feature to track the user activity yet, just feature like change info for user) to track all activity from latest date to oldest date and all matter information, use this structure:
[current setting page in single user details]
[all matter information first - i give you the permission to design best UX and UI as long still use this project own color scheme (read replit.md)].
-- Including IP, device and other all matters information
[the like-table of activity log of the user from latest to oldest

So, the main page is just like manage jobs page in dashboard user while it's display latest jobs. In activity page, it's have to display activity from all user from latest to oldest. With this information that you need to display:
1. Timestamp
2. user
3. Action/events
4. IP
5. and other kind of information that matter if need, but don't too much (place it in single user info if it's needed)

And as before you made the tables with name "indb_admin_activity_logs" we need to change the tables name to other, please read the replit.md to get to know how to naming a tables in correct way using prefix and collections name.
The current structure tables for "indb_admin_activity_logs" is:
INSERT INTO "public"."indb_admin_activity_logs" ("id", "admin_id", "action_type", "action_description", "target_type", "target_id", "ip_address", "user_agent", "metadata", "created_at") VALUES ('1538faa7-f2ac-474e-9672-5550426cbfaa', '915f50e5-0902-466a-b1af-bdf19d789722', 'user_management', 'Viewed users list', 'users', null, null, null, '{"count": 1}', '2025-07-25 06:45:11.835497+00');

If we need to change it, please give the SQL queries for me to run in Supabase SQL Editor
