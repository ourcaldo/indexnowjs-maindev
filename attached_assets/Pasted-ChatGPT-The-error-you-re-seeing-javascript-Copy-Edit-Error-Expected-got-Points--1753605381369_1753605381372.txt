The error you're seeing:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Error: × Expected ',', got '{'
Points to this line:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{statusModalOpen && (
Root Cause
The most likely reason is that you're placing JSX directly inside a component body without wrapping it in a return (...) block or without placing it inside a valid JSX root. However, based on your full file, the real issue is misplaced JSX outside the main component return block.

✅ Correct Placement
Your return already ends here:

tsx
Copy
Edit
    </div>
  )
}
But after that closing curly brace of the component, you still have this block:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{statusModalOpen && (
  <Dialog open={statusModalOpen} onOpenChange={setStatusModalOpen}>
    ...
  </Dialog>
)}
That JSX is outside the return (...), which is invalid syntax in a TypeScript file.

✅ Fix
Move that conditional modal rendering inside the returned JSX block of the component. For example, move it just before the final </div> inside your main return (...) like this:

tsx
Copy
Edit
...
{/* Your main JSX content */}

{statusModalOpen && (
  <Dialog open={statusModalOpen} onOpenChange={setStatusModalOpen}>
    ...
  </Dialog>
)}

</div> // closing tag of return
Or if needed, wrap the whole returned JSX in a fragment <>...</> to allow sibling elements.

TL;DR
Your file ends with:

tsx
Copy
Edit
}
But there's JSX rendered after that, which is illegal.

Fix: Move the statusModalOpen && <Dialog ...> block inside the return (...) of the component.

DeepSeek
Looking at the error message and the code, I can identify the issue:

Error Analysis:

The error occurs at line 768 where there's an unexpected { character

The error suggests a syntax issue where a comma was expected instead of an opening curly brace

Looking at the surrounding code, this appears to be in the middle of JSX rendering

Root Cause:
The issue is that there's an unclosed </div> tag in your JSX structure. The error appears because the parser is confused by the JSX structure when it encounters the {statusModalOpen && ( part.

Solution:

The main problem is in your grid layout structure. You have:

jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {/* Main Content - Order Information (67%) */}
  <div className="lg:col-span-2 space-y-6">
    {/* ... content ... */}
  </div>

  {/* Sidebar - Admin Actions & Activity (33%) */}
  <div className="lg:col-span-1 space-y-6">
    {/* ... content ... */}
  </div>
</div>
But inside the main content section (lg:col-span-2), you have another grid layout that's not properly closed before the sidebar section starts.

Here's how to fix it:

Make sure all opening tags have corresponding closing tags

Properly nest your grid layouts

The simplest fix is to remove the duplicate Customer Information and Package Details sections that appear in both the main content and sidebar areas

Recommended Fix:
Remove the duplicate sections and keep your layout structure clean. The error will disappear once the JSX is properly structured with matching opening and closing tags.

Here's the corrected structure for the main part of your component:

jsx
<div className="space-y-6">
  {/* Header */}
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
    {/* ... header content ... */}
  </div>

  {/* Two Column Layout */}
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
    {/* Main Content - Order Information (67%) */}
    <div className="lg:col-span-2 space-y-6">
      {/* Order Details Card */}
      <Card>{/* ... */}</Card>
      
      {/* Payment & Customer Information Grid */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        {/* Customer Information Card */}
        <Card>{/* ... */}</Card>
        
        {/* Payment Information Card */}
        <Card>{/* ... */}</Card>
      </div>

      {/* Package Details Card */}
      <Card>{/* ... */}</Card>

      {/* Payment Proof Card */}
      {order.payment_proof_url && <Card>{/* ... */}</Card>}
    </div>

    {/* Sidebar - Admin Actions & Activity (33%) */}
    <div className="lg:col-span-1 space-y-6">
      {/* Status Management Card */}
      <Card>{/* ... */}</Card>
      
      {/* Admin Notes Card */}
      <Card>{/* ... */}</Card>
      
      {/* Activity Log Card */}
      <Card>{/* ... */}</Card>
    </div>
  </div>

  {/* Status Modal */}
  {statusModalOpen && (
    <Dialog>{/* ... */}</Dialog>
  )}
</div>
The key is to ensure:

Every opening tag has a matching closing tag

Components are properly nested

No duplicate sections exist in both main content and sidebar

This should resolve your syntax error and make your component render correctly.
