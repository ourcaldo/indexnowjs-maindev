Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

Before we more in-deepth about this project. Please take time to read all information in replit.md because there's a lot important things that you should know.

Before, we already made plan in plan.md please also read that and we'll also already fix a problem about websocket to make the dashboard can provide realtime information and changes.

But, unforttenetly the websocket is still not work, where I still need to reload the page to see new information.

Even though backend is send brodcasting or push the update to the frontend, but in network tree i just saw "wss://36e4f180-ea47-41a9-a095-05fd5bd98d1e-00-2w590e07cc6xk.worf.replit.dev/ws?userId=915f50e5-0902-466a-b1af-bdf19d789722&token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.PVRwhQqoMLH3c-CF1Gn1GzEb1GwnjGIqDP_fXrWGPm4&jobId=16f86f9e-1eda-4ad5-a143-967fc6b1b1d6" is beeing "PENDING" for the first time I open a page untill the jobs is finished and I didn't see any message and all wss request in network tree is pending

I need you to do deep dive and do research about how to implement the websocket in Nextjs, please read this resource: https://blog.logrocket.com/implementing-websocket-communication-next-js/.

If you can't read that, just say to me, I'll provide the resource, don't made changes before you read that.
