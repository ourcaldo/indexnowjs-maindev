Before I ask you to do enhancement/changes, I need you to do:
1. Deep dive into this project, read all code, file and information, specificly in project.md (not replit.md, but still read the replit.md) where you can get the all related this project, database structure and detailed changes log.
2. Always and keep remember that you're SHOULDN'T delete any information in project.md, for every update and changes, you should write in Recent Changes inside the project.md with proper timeline format like the other without delete anything.
3. If you need to make debug/test file to fix the problem, then make it. But keep in mind to delete that file again after it's solved and before you end the action chain.
4. For after every changes you made, don't forget to add it in timeline changlongs in project.md in Recent Changes section.
5. As this project using Supabase database, which you didn't have access directly to it, if you need to know the database format beside that I put in project.md, you can give me SQL queries for me to run to see, changes or update database related. Keep in your mind to not push anything related to DB in your local.

Then, after that I need you to revamp (full revamp, not just change the color in any elements in the dashboard) the user dashboard (/dashboard) with this details:

1. Only the main page in user dashboard (/dashboard)
2. The new dashboard must be still simple and clean, but not monoton. Still keep it profesional and use color pallete from the project.md, make sure to not use single color, but at the same time don't use too much and different color, which don't use too much different color, but keep in mind that each color must be have good contrast.
3. In new dashboard, don't use or add heading/title and the description 
4. In the new dashboard, I want to more focus or make the IndexNow Rank Tracker more standout and make the Fast Indexing as additional tools. So, please use less or not use the widget or any elements related to fast indexing
