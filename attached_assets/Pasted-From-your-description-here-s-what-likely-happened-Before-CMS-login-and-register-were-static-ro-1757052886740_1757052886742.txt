From your description, hereâ€™s what likely happened:

Before CMS

/login and /register were static routes/pages in your app (probably under pages/login.tsx or app/login/page.tsx in Next.js).

They worked fine because the router knew exactly which file to serve.

After CMS / Catch-all Dynamic Route

You created something like [slug].tsx or app/[slug]/page.tsx to serve CMS pages like /privacy, /terms, /tos.

That dynamic route also catches /login and /register, since they also match the [slug] pattern.

Inside your code, when /login is requested, your CMS logic checks the database for a "login" slug â†’ not found â†’ returns 404.

Thatâ€™s why your auth pages broke.

âœ… How to Fix
You need to tell the router to prioritize static routes over dynamic ones. There are a few ways:

If youâ€™re using Next.js (Pages Router):

Ensure pages/login.tsx and pages/register.tsx exist.

Place your CMS route as pages/[slug].tsx.

Next.js automatically prioritizes exact matches (/login) over dynamic (/[slug]).
ðŸ‘‰ If itâ€™s still broken, it means your [slug].tsx is catch-all ([...slug].tsx). That will override everything, including /login.

Fix:

// pages/[slug].tsx (NOT [...slug].tsx)


If you must use catch-all ([...slug]), then add an exception:

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const slug = context.params.slug?.[0] ?? "";

  // Prevent overriding login/register
  if (slug === "login" || slug === "register") {
    return { notFound: true }; // Let Next.js serve static route
  }

  // Your CMS fetch logic here...
}

If youâ€™re using Next.js (App Router):

Keep /app/login/page.tsx and /app/register/page.tsx as static routes.

CMS should be /app/[slug]/page.tsx (not [...slug]).

If you really need catch-all ([...slug]), then add logic in notFound():

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const slug = params.slug?.[0] ?? "";

  if (slug === "login" || slug === "register") {
    notFound(); // Fallback to static pages
  }

  // Fetch from DB
}


âš¡ Summary:
Your CMS route is overriding /login and /register.
ðŸ‘‰ Solution: donâ€™t use a greedy catch-all unless you add exceptions, or restructure your routes so static auth pages take precedence.
