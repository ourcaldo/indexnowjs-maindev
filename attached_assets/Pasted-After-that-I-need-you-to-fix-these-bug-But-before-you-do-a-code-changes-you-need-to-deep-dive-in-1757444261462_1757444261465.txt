After that, I need you to fix these bug. But, before you do a code changes, you need to deep dive into the issues and problem to find what is the real problem. If you need another information or clarify something, you can ask me to do anything.
You can't take action to directly changes the codes without my permission or confirmation.

The bug that you need to deep dive is these:
1. I've tried to sign up with new account then placed Free Trial as usually. After that, I go to Settings page and Plans and Billing, but when I saw 
2. When I checkout, there's an issue in Billing Period selector, when I try to choose the option from top to the bottom, it's working as fine. But, when I choose monthly, and choose annual then I try to choose the top option which is montly again, I can't. It's like the option isn't selectable. You already add the debug before, but not solved the problem. There's also didn't appear any problem in my debug console, just this when the monthly option is can't be selected "[Violation] 'click' handler took 213ms"
3. In order success page, which show the details. The current URL is "/dashboard/settings/plans-billing/orders/29d85f29-699b-4eb9-8b32-8d47ca64fc70" there's customer information which when user didn't fill the billing address the billing address will be "," then the country, it's bit akward for me. So, just don't show the billing address if user didn't fill it, but still show the country and add auto redirect 5s back to the Plans and Billing settings/plans-billing/orders/29d85f29-699b-4eb9-8b32-8d47ca64fc70
4. For trial packages is 3 days, before I do ask you to make the trial is 5 minutes for testing purposes. But I already ask you to change it to 3 days again, but it's still fucking 5 minutes
5. In Plans and Billing Setting, there's are card that show the quota usage details, for the new account that I just created, it's show my keyword tracking usage is 147/50 (basic plans), which it's fucking so wrong, bcs I even not fucking add any keyword. Even in tables indb_keyword_usage keyword usage data for this usage also not available yet. For fucking basic the service account also should 1 max, but it's show 1. I things this fucking more minor error but so fucking fucking stupid.
