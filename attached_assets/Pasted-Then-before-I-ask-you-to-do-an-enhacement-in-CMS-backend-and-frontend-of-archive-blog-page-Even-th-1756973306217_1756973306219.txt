Then, before I ask you to do an enhacement in CMS backend and frontend of archive blog page. Even though it's already good, there's still room for an enhacement. Please read what I said carefully:
1. Before I ask you to add an ajax category button which show all (execpt uncategorized) availables category and you already made it. But, when the category is choosen, it's show active category filter in green color which I don't want that, we didn't need that, the ajax change of grid post list is enough when the category is choosen by visitor.
2. Related to category in the CMS backend, my POV is you're hardcoded the option of category which I didn't quite like it. Like a wordpress, I must be can to add new category and choose multiple category for a blog post that I've made. But still the main category is just 1. Please do like a wordpress, where's there main category and child category, and the slug is still like the current one which is "/blog/[category]/slug"
3. Then, for the post grid in archive page, you're add a like buble category in left top corner of the images, which I very like it. But, please optimize it, don't use the slug, but use the label. At the moment, you're use "case-studies" which is category slug for the category "Case Studies" so we need to use the label.
4. Then, there's another error in dynamic category page, which is like "/blog/case-studies" when I open I got this error in console browser:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slug')
