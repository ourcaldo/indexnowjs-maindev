Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

Before we more in-deepth about this project. Please take time to read all information in replit.md because there's a lot important things that you should know.

Before, we already made plan in plan.md and I ask you to make dashboard for admin to manage entire side. But, when I login with super_admin role, there's error like this and I need you to fix it.

Please make sure you're read the replit.md to get current latest tables and column.

Before, I ask you to enhance the activity log in admin dashboard and we already do that, but there's still error that you need to fix, please see this error log:
