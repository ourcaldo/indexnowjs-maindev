Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

Before we more in-deepth about this project. Please take time to read all information in replit.md because there's a lot important things that you should know.

Before, we already made plan in plan.md and I ask you to make dashboard for admin to manage entire side. But, when I login with super_admin role, there's error like this and I need you to fix it.

Please make sure you're read the replit.md to get current latest tables and column.

Before, I ask you to enhance the activity log in admin dashboard with this command:
'''
Thanks, now I need you to enhance the activity logs in admin dashboard which have this error when I access it.

 At the first place, I ask you to make the activity logs like this: "Activity Logs: Track backend events, user actions (logins, changes, API calls), and system warnings or errors for audits and debugging."

But, the actual you're just make the activity log for the admin user, which what admin super do while in admin dashboard. 

So, I need you to change, fix and enhance it. I want you to make sure that the activity logs is record all user and all activity which also display the user name and also have single activity detail when we click it will have single page (when user is clicked, it's redirected to single user detail, we already have this single page under user management but didn't have the feature to track the user activity yet, just feature like change info for user) to track all activity from latest date to oldest date and all matter information, use this structure:
[current setting page in single user details]
[all matter information first - i give you the permission to design best UX and UI as long still use this project own color scheme (read replit.md)].
-- Including IP, device and other all matters information
[the like-table of activity log of the user from latest to oldest

So, the main page is just like manage jobs page in dashboard user while it's display latest jobs. In activity page, it's have to display activity from all user from latest to oldest. With this information that you need to display:
1. Timestamp
2. user
3. Action/events
4. IP
5. and other kind of information that matter if need, but don't too much (place it in single user info if it's needed)

And as before you made the tables with name "indb_admin_activity_logs" we need to change the tables name to other, please read the replit.md to get to know how to naming a tables in correct way using prefix and collections name.
The current structure tables for "indb_admin_activity_logs" is:
INSERT INTO "public"."indb_admin_activity_logs" ("id", "admin_id", "action_type", "action_description", "target_type", "target_id", "ip_address", "user_agent", "metadata", "created_at") VALUES ('1538faa7-f2ac-474e-9672-5550426cbfaa', '915f50e5-0902-466a-b1af-bdf19d789722', 'user_management', 'Viewed users list', 'users', null, null, null, '{"count": 1}', '2025-07-25 06:45:11.835497+00');

If we need to change it, please give the SQL queries for me to run in Supabase SQL Editor

'''

Then you made a changes and give this SQL that I also already run it.
-- Activity Logs Migration: Rename table and create comprehensive activity tracking
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Create new comprehensive activity logs table following collections naming convention
-- Using "security" collection for activity tracking: indb_security_activity_logs

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.indb_security_activity_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- login, logout, create_job, update_profile, api_call, etc.

-- 2. Create indexes for performance

-- 3. Migrate existing data from old table to new table if exists
INSERT INTO public.indb_security_activity_logs (

    created_at
FROM public.indb_admin_activity_logs
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'indb_admin_activity_logs');

-- 4. Create RLS policies for the new table
ALTER TABLE public.indb_security_activity_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can only see their own activity logs
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own activity logs" ON public.indb_security_activity_logs
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Service role can manage all activity logs
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access" ON public.indb_security_activity_logs
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- 5. Drop old table after migration (uncomment if you want to remove old table)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.indb_admin_activity_logs;

-- 6. Grant necessary permissions
GRANT ALL ON public.indb_security_activity_logs TO service_role;
GRANT SELECT ON public.indb_security_activity_logs TO authenticated;

-- 7. Create a function to log activity automatically
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.log_user_activity(

But now after you made that, I quite not like it. Please see my feedback:
1. In latest activity there's no header and numbering even though I ask for ordering latest date, I need numbering
2. I don't quite like the design
3. The event type, I don't quite like it
4. The icon device, it's too simple, and didn't have a text which I don't like it.
5. Not symetrical, the timestap is on up, the other is center
6. When I click the user, it's do redirected to single user detail page, but it's doesn't have activity history dedicated for that user under the current content of single detail user.

Overall, I didn't quite like the current design, which lack for UX. So help me to redesign it as I said, I give you permission to make the layout but still use color scheme in replit.md
