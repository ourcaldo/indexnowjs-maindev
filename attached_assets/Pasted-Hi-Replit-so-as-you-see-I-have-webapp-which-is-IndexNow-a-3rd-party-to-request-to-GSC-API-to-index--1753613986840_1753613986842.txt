Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

Before I want you to more in-deepth about this project. Please take time to read all information in replit.md because there's a lot important things (from database to all changelogs) that you should know.

After that, I need your help to fix an error when I try to add a jobs Indexing using sitemap, the job is successfully added, but when backend is try to proccess it, it's failed with error regarding to url.

My POV is, backend can't get the URLs list from the sitemap that user put. Please see this SQL:
INSERT INTO "public"."indb_indexing_jobs" ("id", "user_id", "name", "type", "status", "schedule_type", "cron_expression", "source_data", "total_urls", "processed_urls", "successful_urls", "failed_urls", "progress_percentage", "started_at", "completed_at", "next_run_at", "error_message", "created_at", "updated_at", "locked_at", "locked_by") VALUES ('7fdd14d4-16ff-4f60-b129-c1813a8a17d3', '915f50e5-0902-466a-b1af-bdf19d789722', '#Job-8', 'sitemap', 'failed', 'one-time', null, '{"sitemap_url": "https://nexjob.tech/sitemap-loker-1.xml"}', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0.00', '2025-07-27 10:56:02.633+00', null, null, 'No sitemap URL found in job source data', '2025-07-27 10:55:12.327+00', '2025-07-27 10:56:03.796784+00', null, null);

That's show that the source "{"sitemap_url": "https://nexjob.tech/sitemap-loker-1.xml"}" which is when backend proced it, the backend should be get the URLs from the sitemap, it's also use this logic when re-run a jobs with source data from sitemap, so when URLs inside of the sitemaps is change, the webapp can get and always send request for new urls.

Please help me to fix this issue.
