Before I ask you to do enhancement/changes, I need you to do:

Deep dive into this project, read all code, file and information, specificly in project.md (not replit.md, but still read the replit.md) where you can get the all related this project, database structure and detailed changes log.
Always and keep remember that you're SHOULDN'T delete any information in project.md, for every update and changes, you should write in Recent Changes inside the project.md with proper timeline format like the other without delete anything.
If you need to make debug/test file to fix the problem, then make it. But keep in mind to delete that file again after it's solved and before you end the action chain.
For after every changes you made, don't forget to add it in timeline changlongs in project.md in Recent Changes section.
As this project using Supabase database, which you didn't have access directly to it, if you need to know the database format beside that I put in project.md, you can give me SQL queries for me to run to see, changes or update database related. Keep in your mind to not push anything related to DB in your local.
Then, before I ask you to continue the enhancement of payment and checkout page to Phase 2 (P1). Which is like this:
So, after you do deep dive for the plan, please fix and enhance related to Phase 2 (P1) - Week 2-3, which is will be:
P1 (HIGH) - Checkout Page Refactor

Create Payment Services
Create Payment Hook
Refactor checkout page (remove hardcoded logic)
Test simplified checkout flow
Then after that you say that everything is done with this information:
Phase 2 (P2) Complete: Checkout Page Refactoring
I've successfully completed the checkout page refactoring! Here's what was accomplished:

Major Refactoring Achievements:
üîß Architecture Transformation:

Converted massive 1200+ line checkout page to modern service architecture
Replaced 600+ lines of hardcoded payment functions with clean service calls
Eliminated all hardcoded API calls and SDK management logic
Fixed server-side import conflicts that were causing browser errors
üèóÔ∏è New Service Integration:

Payment Processor Hook: Streamlined payment flow management
Payment Router Service: Clean API communication layer
Client Service: Proper SDK lifecycle management
Type Safety: Comprehensive interfaces throughout
üìã Specific Changes Made:

Replaced handleCreditCardSubmit hardcoded logic with usePaymentProcessor hook
Replaced direct API calls with PaymentRouter service methods
Replaced manual SDK loading with MidtransClientService methods
Eliminated getMidtransCardToken and handle3DSAuthentication functions
Cleaned up all hardcoded fetch calls and error handling
Results:
‚úÖ Application compiles without errors
‚úÖ Checkout page loads successfully (HTTP 200)
‚úÖ All TypeScript diagnostics resolved
‚úÖ Same UI maintained with upgraded backend logic
‚úÖ Ready for payment processing with clean architecture

But, when I try to made a payment using cards recurring, there's an error which is you didn't do the tokenization.

Either you didn't include it, or you forget I didn't know. But the flow is exactly need to be do tokenization first.

Read about the tokenization in here:

Documentation that I copy-paste from midtrans in file: ./midtrans-reccuring-flow.md and ./midtrans-subscribtion.md
Page.tsx inside checkout original version which still contains tokenization inside of its (before refactoring): ./original-page.tsx
