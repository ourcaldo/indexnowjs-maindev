Then, in the dashboard it's display the keyword, position, 1D 3D and 7D (which is the differentiation rank), Volume, Link, Last update date.

When user want to add a new keyword to track, it's almost same like Semrush, where's user need to put the keyword list (new line seperated), select devices Mobile/Desktop, Country, ttag (optional).

As in this project use Supabase, so don't push/install any locally DB. Bcs you don't have direct access to supabase, give me the SQL to run on supabase to update/changes/add table or column or if you need any information related database. Further tables and column name is on replit.md.

For sure, you need to add limitation on each packages, which the current packages is Free, Pro Premium. The free is can add up to 50 keywords, the Premium is can add up to 250 keyword and the Pro is can have up to 1500 keywords.

Each keyword, devices and country is consume 1 quota, so if user track same keyword but different device its still consume quota, like the semrush.

The current schema for the packages is like this and you should add the limitation on quota_limits column that have data like this:

{"daily_urls": 500, "concurrent_jobs": 3, "service_accounts": 3}

The full scheme:
create table public.indb_payment_packages (
id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),
name text not null,
slug text not null,
description text null,
price numeric(10, 2) not null default 0,

billing_period text null default 'monthly'::text,
features jsonb null default '[]'::jsonb,
quota_limits jsonb null default '{}'::jsonb,
is_active boolean null default true,
sort_order integer null default 0,
created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
updated_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),

constraint indb_payment_packages_pkey primary key (id),
