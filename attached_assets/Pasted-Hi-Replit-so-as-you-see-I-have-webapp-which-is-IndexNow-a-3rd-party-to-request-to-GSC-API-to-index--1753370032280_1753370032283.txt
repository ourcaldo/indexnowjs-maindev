Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

Before we more in-deepth about this project. Please take time to read all information in replit.md because there's a lot important things that you should know.

Before, we already made plan in plan.md 

Before I already ask you to fix the pooling websockets which we completely agree to use wss, not pooling mechanism to decrease the endpoint to being called every seconds.

But, now when I see the network tree, I still can see the endpoint "api/socke" and "ocketio/?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.AcyeN1oeAOQLMcd2zdcn_dhv5Zd7wo3mvfQCb6L4y-4&userId=915f50e5-0902-466a-b1af-bdf19d789722&jobId=16f86f9e-1eda-4ad5-a143-967fc6b1b1d6&EIO=4&transport=websocket" is beeing called, even it's not as much when we use pooling, it's still quite much.

From the console log, you can see that there's a bunch of logs that client x is being subscribed to the websockets even thought I just open the dashboard from 1 browser and didn't explore the page (I stay on the same page).

I need you to fix this, make sure that we use correct websockets and the dashboard still refflect realtime changes.
