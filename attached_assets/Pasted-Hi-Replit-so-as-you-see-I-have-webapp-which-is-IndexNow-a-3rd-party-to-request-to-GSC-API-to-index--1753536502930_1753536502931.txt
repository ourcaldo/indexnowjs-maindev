Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

Before we more in-deepth about this project. Please take time to read all information in replit.md because there's a lot important things that you should know.

Before, we already made Plans and Billing menu and also a checkout page, so user can directly purchase and upgrade their subscription, please check the changelogs in replit.md to get all information. 

But, after we do an updates, there's few error that you need to fix, which is:
1. When I try to upgrade an package from Free to Premium and it's redirected to checkout page, we're got "Package not found"
2. There's an error related to toast notification
