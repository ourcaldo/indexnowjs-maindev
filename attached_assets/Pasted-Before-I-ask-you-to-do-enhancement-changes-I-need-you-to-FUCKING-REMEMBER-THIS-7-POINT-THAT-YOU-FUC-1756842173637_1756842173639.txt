Before I ask you to do enhancement/changes, I need you to FUCKING REMEMBER THIS 7 POINT THAT YOU FUCKING STILL MISS IT.
1. Deep dive into this project, read all code, file and information, specificly in project.md (not replit.md, but still read the replit.md) where you can get the all related this project, database structure and detailed changes log. Don't just fucking use grep to get few lines to read it, fucking open the file and read the full context.
2. Always and keep remember that you're SHOULDN'T delete any information in project.md, for every update and changes, you should write in Recent Changes inside the project.md with proper timeline format like the other without delete anything.
3. If you need to make debug/test file to fix the problem, then make it. But keep in mind to delete that file again after it's solved and before you end the action chain.
4. For after every changes you made, don't forget to add it in timeline changlongs in project.md in Recent Changes section.
5. As this project using Supabase database, which you didn't have access directly to it, if you need to know the database format beside that I put in project.md, you can give me SQL queries for me to run to see, changes or update database related. Keep in your mind to not push anything related to DB in your local.
6. If you need to add debug, never use console.log that can appear on user's browser, we don't want that.
7. New features or any that I ask must be good refactoed code, not single code that handle all functions.

I don't fucking know how I fucking should tell you. I fucking ask you to fucking fix this issue for fucking 4-5 times, after you fucking change code (a lots of code) you didn't fucking fix anything.

The problem is, for fucking first time login to user dashboard, the fucking skeleton is got stuck until I fucking reload it and everything back normal. The fucking things that you should know is:
1. After login, it's do redirecting to /dashboard with last 2 network activity is '../token?grant' from supabase authentication and 'api/v1/auth/session'
2. After it's redirected to /dashboard, it's got stuck without any network activity happen
3. I fucking need to reload the page to get normal view and everything back to normal

So, my fucking question is, why it's still fucking redirecting to /dashboard and login is do success, but it's not fucking show any network activity after it's login. 

I also fucking ask you to find the real issue, not just fucking add debug here and there and fucking not fix the real issue. So, for fucking this time, please fucking find the real issue, fucking don't change the code yet before I fcking ask you to do that.
