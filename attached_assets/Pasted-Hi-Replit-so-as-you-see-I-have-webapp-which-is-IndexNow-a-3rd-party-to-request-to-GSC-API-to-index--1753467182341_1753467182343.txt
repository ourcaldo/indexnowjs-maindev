Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

Before we more in-deepth about this project. Please take time to read all information in replit.md because there's a lot important things that you should know.

Before, we already made plan in plan.md and I ask you to make dashboard for admin to manage entire side. But, when I login with super_admin role, there's error like this and I need you to fix it.

Please make sure you're read the replit.md to get current latest tables and column.

Before, I ask you to enhance the site settings in admin dashboard and ask you to make sure that all pages is using this settings.

My command is:
'''
Thanks, it's solved. Now, as I already set and update the site settings, I need you to make sure that every page is using site setting from this admin panel.

This is the SQL for site settings: "INSERT INTO "public"."indb_site_settings" ("id", "site_name", "site_description", "site_logo_url", "site_icon_url", "site_favicon_url", "contact_email", "support_email", "maintenance_mode", "registration_enabled", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES ('474f9d67-17b5-4e11-9c46-b61614d17a59', 'IndexNow Pro', 'Professional URL indexing automation platform', 'https://bwkasvyrzbzhcdtvsbyg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/indexnow-bucket/logo/indexnow-black.png', 'https://bwkasvyrzbzhcdtvsbyg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/indexnow-bucket/logo/indexnow-icon-black.png', 'https://bwkasvyrzbzhcdtvsbyg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/indexnow-bucket/logo/IndexNow-icon.png', 'aldo@indexnow.studio', 'help@indexnow.studio', 'false', 'true', '2025-07-24 18:08:18.048476+00', '2025-07-25 17:49:10.754+00');"

Fyi, the site logo is used when the sidebar is expanded, then when it's collapsed it's using icon for the logo, for the favicon, it's using favicon.

Make sure all of that is used among all pages
'''

It's does already very good, but I still have some feedback for improvement, which is:
1. Logo for the sidebar when it's expanded is too small, make it a bit more bigger, at the moment, but still proporsional for desktop and non desktop device
