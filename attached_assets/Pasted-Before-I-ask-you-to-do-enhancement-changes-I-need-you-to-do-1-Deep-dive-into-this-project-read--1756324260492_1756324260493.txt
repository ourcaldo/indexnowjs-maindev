Before I ask you to do enhancement/changes, I need you to do:
1. Deep dive into this project, read all code, file and information, specificly in project.md (not replit.md, but still read the replit.md) where you can get the all related this project, database structure and detailed changes log. Don't just fucking use grep to get few lines to read it, fucking open the file and read the full context.
2. Always and keep remember that you're SHOULDN'T delete any information in project.md, for every update and changes, you should write in Recent Changes inside the project.md with proper timeline format like the other without delete anything.
3. If you need to make debug/test file to fix the problem, then make it. But keep in mind to delete that file again after it's solved and before you end the action chain.
4. For after every changes you made, don't forget to add it in timeline changlongs in project.md in Recent Changes section.
5. As this project using Supabase database, which you didn't have access directly to it, if you need to know the database format beside that I put in project.md, you can give me SQL queries for me to run to see, changes or update database related. Keep in your mind to not push anything related to DB in your local.
6. If you need to add debug, never use console.log that can appear on user's browser, we don't want that.

Then, before I ask you to continue to the enhancement of free trial features. After you do that, there's some issue and you ask me to run the SQL queries:
The issue is:
1. Why in plans and billing section there's have new section which before I said to add the button "Get Free Trial" so each plan is have 2 button. Just show the button if user didn't use the free trial before
2. WHen I try to checkout a plan by adding parameter by myself trial=true, I saw that the charge request is still on full price (see the console log)

-- First, let's check the current policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'indb_auth_user_profiles';

-- Drop any recursive policies and recreate simple ones
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON indb_auth_user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON indb_auth_user_profiles;

-- Create new simple policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON indb_auth_user_profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON indb_auth_user_profiles
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE indb_auth_user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

The result is:
