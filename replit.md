## User Preferences

- **Architecture:** The project strictly uses Next.js with NO VITE. Database operations require SQL queries for Supabase SQL Editor. Database table names must follow the `indb_{collections}_{table-name}` prefix.
- **Color Scheme:** Use ONLY the defined project color scheme. Reference images are for layout/UI inspiration ONLY, not color.
  - Background: #FFFFFF (Pure White), #F7F9FC (Light Gray)
  - Primary: #1A1A1A (Graphite), #2C2C2E (Charcoal)
  - Accent: #3D8BFF (Soft Blue)
  - Text: #6C757D (Slate Gray)
  - Success: #4BB543 (Mint Green)
  - Warning: #F0A202 (Amber)

  - Borders: #E0E6ED (Cool Gray)
  - Button Colors: #1C2331, #0d1b2a, #22333b, #1E1E1E
- **Database Changes:** For any database updates/changes/additions/removals, provide SQL queries for user to run in Supabase SQL Editor. Do not install PostgreSQL locally or push database changes locally.
- **General Working Preferences:** Do not make changes to the folder `Z`. Do not make changes to the file `Y`.

## System Architecture
