## User Preferences

- **Migration Status:** Project successfully migrated to Replit environment on 2025-08-13. All systems operational.
- **Architecture:** The project strictly uses Next.js with NO VITE. Database operations require SQL queries for Supabase SQL Editor. Database table names must follow the `indb_{collections}_{table-name}` prefix.
- **Color Scheme:** Use ONLY the defined project color scheme. Reference images are for layout/UI inspiration ONLY, not color.
  - Background: #FFFFFF (Pure White), #F7F9FC (Light Gray)
  - Primary: #1A1A1A (Graphite), #2C2C2E (Charcoal)
