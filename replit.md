# IndexNow Pro - Professional Web Application

## Project Overview

IndexNow Pro is a professional-grade, full-stack web application designed to automate Google URL indexing through the Google Search Console API. Built as a comprehensive solution for SEO professionals, digital marketers, and website owners who need efficient large-scale indexing operations with advanced monitoring and reporting.

### Core Purpose
The application provides instant indexing capabilities similar to RankMath's Instant Indexing plugin, but as a standalone web platform that handles multiple service accounts, scheduled jobs, and enterprise-scale indexing operations.

### Key Features
- **Automated Google Indexing**: Submit thousands of URLs to Google's Indexing API automatically
- **Multi-Service Account Management**: Load balance across multiple Google service accounts
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Support for one-time, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly indexing jobs
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time job tracking, quota monitoring, and detailed analytics
- **Professional Email Notifications**: Branded email reports for job completion, failures, and quota alerts
- **Enterprise Security**: Role-based access control, input validation, and security auditing

## Recent Changes  
**Authentication & Build System Fix (January 25, 2025)**
- ✅ Fixed critical admin authentication issue causing "Super admin access required" errors
- ✅ Resolved Next.js 15 build error with "next/headers" import conflicts between server/client components
- ✅ Consolidated server-side authentication functions directly in admin-auth.ts to avoid import chain issues
- ✅ Updated all admin API routes to use proper server-side authentication with NextRequest parameters
- ✅ Fixed Next.js 15 dynamic params issue - params now properly awaited in admin user routes
- ✅ Modified `requireSuperAdminAuth()` and `requireAdminAuth()` functions to accept NextRequest parameter
- ✅ Ensured consistent authentication across all admin endpoints (dashboard, users, user detail, password reset, suspend)
- ✅ Admin dashboard now fully functional with working user management features
- ✅ Migration from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment completed successfully

## CRITICAL PROJECT CAUTIONS - ALWAYS REMEMBER

⚠️ **ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Next.js ONLY** - This project uses Next.js with NO VITE. Never suggest or implement Vite migration.
2. **Supabase Self-Hosted** - Database is hosted at https://base.indexnow.studio
   - Do NOT install PostgreSQL locally
   - Do NOT push database changes locally
   - For any database updates/changes/additions/removals, provide SQL queries for user to run in Supabase SQL Editor
   - You must be follow this prefix "indb_{collections}_{table-name}" "collections" is like same collections, for example like "security" collection which have tables "indb_security_event", "indb_security_log" and so-on.
3. **Project Color Scheme ONLY** - Use ONLY this project's color scheme:
   - Background: #FFFFFF (Pure White), #F7F9FC (Light Gray)
   - Primary: #1A1A1A (Graphite), #2C2C2E (Charcoal)
   - Accent: #3D8BFF (Soft Blue)
   - Text: #6C757D (Slate Gray)
   - Success: #4BB543 (Mint Green)
   - Warning: #F0A202 (Amber)
   - Error: #E63946 (Rose Red)
   - Borders: #E0E6ED (Cool Gray)
   - Button Colors: #1C2331, #0d1b2a, #22333b, #1E1E1E
   - If user sends reference images, they are for layout/UI inspiration ONLY - still use project colors

## Current Database Schema (Supabase Tables)
If an updates affectig the database and RLS. You need to provide the SQL Query for me to run in Supabase SQL Editor. Keep in mind that to make new tables, you must be follow this prefix "indb_{collections}_{table-name}" "collections" is like same collections, for example like "security" collection which have tables "indb_security_event", "indb_security_log" and so-on.

All tables use `indb_` prefix and are located at https://base.indexnow.studio:

  - **Supabase authentication integration**: WebSocket connections now require valid JWT tokens from Supabase auth
  - **User profile verification**: Added verification against `indb_auth_user_profiles` table for additional security
  - **Real-time authentication**: JWT tokens are obtained from current session and passed in WebSocket URL
  - **Connection security**: Invalid tokens or missing user profiles result in connection rejection
- **Comprehensive real-time dashboard functionality**:
  - **Dashboard statistics**: Live updates via WebSocket with custom events for stats changes
  - **Job management**: Real-time job status, progress, and completion updates across all pages
  - **URL submissions**: Live tracking of individual URL submission status changes

### 2025-01-25: WebSocket Polling Fix & P1.4 Error Handling Completed ✅

**✅ FIXED: WebSocket Polling Issue - Converted to Pure WebSocket Mode**:
- **Root Cause**: Socket.IO was using polling transport instead of pure WebSocket connections
- **Solution Applied**: Configured both server and client to use `transports: ['websocket']` only
- **Server Configuration**: Added `transports: ['websocket']`, `upgrade: false`, `allowUpgrades: false` 
- **Client Configuration**: Matching WebSocket-only transport settings with proper timeouts
- **Result**: Eliminated polling requests to `/api/socketio/?token=...` - now uses true WebSocket connections
- **Verification**: Added transport logging to confirm WebSocket-only mode in browser console

**✅ COMPLETED P1.4: Comprehensive Error Handling System with Proper Table Naming**

**✅ COMPLETED P1.4: Insufficient Error Handling System**:
- **Enterprise-Grade Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling infrastructure using Pino structured logging
- **Security-First Design**: User-friendly error messages for frontend, detailed technical logs for debugging
- **10 Error Classifications**: AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION, VALIDATION, DATABASE, EXTERNAL_API, ENCRYPTION, RATE_LIMITING, SYSTEM, NETWORK, BUSINESS_LOGIC
- **Database Error Tracking**: Created proper table naming following collections:
  - `indb_system_error_logs` (system collection) - Error logging table
  - `indb_analytics_error_stats` (analytics collection) - Error analytics view
- **Fixed SQL Script**: Updated database_schema_update.sql to handle existing policies and prevent conflicts
- **API Middleware**: Reusable authentication, validation, and error handling middleware for consistent error responses
- **Enhanced API Routes**: Updated service accounts and authentication APIs with new error handling system
- **Correlation IDs**: Each error gets unique UUID for tracking without exposing sensitive data
- **Performance Optimized**: Async database recording, automatic cleanup of old errors, optimized indexes

**Key Improvements**:
- Users see helpful messages like "Can't add service account" instead of database error details
- Backend logs full technical context for debugging with severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- All authentication attempts logged for security auditing
- Error analytics available for pattern identification and system monitoring

- **✅ COMPLETED P2.2: Missing Database Indexes**: Added 13 critical performance indexes on frequently queried columns (user_id, status, job_id, service_account_id, etc.) with verified high usage rates for authentication and quota tracking
- **✅ COMPLETED P2.3: Row Level Security Implementation**: Implemented comprehensive RLS policies on all 11 user tables ensuring complete data isolation between users with conditional policy creation to prevent conflicts
- **Enhanced Security**: Users can now only access their own data (jobs, service accounts, submissions, notifications) with system service maintaining necessary access for background operations
- **Verified Performance**: Index usage statistics show high utilization of critical indexes (320+ scans for user profiles, 173+ for quota tracking) confirming optimization success
- **Database Architecture**: Complete security and performance foundation established for scalable multi-user operations
